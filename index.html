        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        As an educator in graphic design, I find myself constantly questioning the traditional practices and education
        in this field, especially in light of the rapid technological changes that shape our world. How can design
        programs stay relevant in the face of such quick advancements? Is what I teach truly important and relevant in
        today’s ever-changing landscape? Am I teaching in a responsible and aware manner? <br>
        While keeping up with technological advancements can partially equip students for their future careers,
        relying
        solely on technical skills in our teaching is insufficient. Furthermore, depending too heavily on standardized
        digital tools can flatten aesthetics and turn future professionals into mere executors rather than creative
        innovators. We must focus on teaching students how to learn, fostering critical thinking skills, and promoting
        values that go beyond hard skills.<br><br>
        What if we shifted the paradigm of graphic design education to prioritize values over a technicality? This
        questioning has inspired me to propose—as part of my master’s thesis in Transdisciplinary New Media—a graphic
        design program: an experiment that focuses on approaching projects considering contemporary issues such as
        accessibility and affordability as part of the learning environment.<br>
        This program is open and free, intended to be shared, copied, used, and nurtured by the community. The
        ambition
        is to propose a collaborative project aimed at reimagining graphic design education in a way that fosters
        values, flexibility, and critical thinking skills. I hope this proposal will be activated in various ways,
        with
        people appropriating and contributing to its growth. <br><br>

        In this publication, you will read the general description of the program, its objectives, and the description
        of each learning component. To read about our values and commitments, refer to the last section, <i>Notes
          About
          Our
          Values</i>. Finally, if you want to know more about the theoretical references related to this project, you
        can read
        my master’s Thesis, <i>From Processing to Design: Free Open Source Culture and the Redefinition of
          Contemporary
          Graphic Design Practice</i>.

          <div class="oneCol">
            <i>A New *New* Program for Graphic Design</i> is a proposal for an open program aiming to distance the
            graphic
            design practice from standardized production methods and aesthetics. By adopting free open source tools
            and
            fostering alternative methodologies, this program wants to encompass values of accessibility and inclusion
            as critical parts of the learning experience.<br><br>
            Access, Community, and Free are the three principal axes of each learning component. The program seeks to
            develop working laboratories where the hybridization of tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory
            generative design, and the use of the web as an open framework become valid propositions for a renewal of
            the practice based on responsibility and flexibility.<br><br>
            Can we shape a graphic design practice by prioritizing critical thinking and ethical values instead of
            technical skills and design components? Can we teach graphic design within an environment that
            incorporates
            an interdisciplinary approach and collaborative methodologies, liberating graphic design production from
            the
            dominance of technological infrastructures? Inspired by teaching and research experiments such as Muriel
            Cooper’s Visual Language Workshop and built upon the shoulders of the Processing community’s core values,
            A
            New *New* Program for Graphic Design tries to answer these questions.<br><br>


            <h2>Access, Community, Free: Core Values</h2>
            <p class="quote">In 2015, I re-assessed this list and synthesized it to this core:<br>
              • Access<br>
              • Community<br>
              • Free (Libre, Libero)<br>
              I feel that with more detail (as I have started to flesh out above), these three points are the core of
              Processing and they differentiate its approach from proprietary, consumer-driven software.<br>

              — Reas, “Thoughts on Software for the Visual Arts”,
              2017</p><br>
            Graphic design history and practice have been intrinsically linked to the technological advancements of
            its
            tools. From the development of the movable-type printing press, which redefined typography and created new
            relationships with alphabets, to the advent of offset printing and photocopy machines that democratized
            the
            production and distribution of artist books and fanzines, technology has empowered design aesthetics and
            methodologies. The introduction of personal computers, notably the first Macintosh in 1984, brought new
            opportunities for graphic design research and production, enabling methodological and esthetical
            experimentations. However, as the transition to the 21st century occurred, this momentum dissipated,
            culminating in a crisis of creative methodologies.<br><br>
            Companies such as Apple, Adobe, and Google have been influential in driving the technological revolution
            in
            design. In their efforts to provide easy-to-use computers, interfaces, and tools, they have standardized
            design aesthetics and fostered the commodification of design culture rather than promoting its
            democratization.
            However, since the release, in 2001, of its first programming environment, the Processing community has
            questioned this paradigm and provided alternatives to creative tools and processes, confronting the
            commodification of design culture imposed by tech monopolies. Built upon the free and open source
            approach,
            the Processing project and community have provided new meanings to the expression “open source,” and have
            fostered a new vision of shared and decentralized collaboration in fields that not only deal with software
            development.<br><br>
            Processing has played a vital role in fostering alternative paths in graphic design. Driven by the values
            of
            Access, Community, and Free, new patterns in graphic design have emerged: first, the rise of hybrid
            practices, merging analog and digital tools, showed how the free open source sharing model and DIY
            methodologies had empowered accessibility and democratized design conception and production (Access).
            Moreover, the influence of generative design and creative coding revealed how design could focus on
            “multiple,” as opposed to “universal,” and can open conversations with diverse communities by integrating
            participatory processes (Community). Finally, reappropriating the publishing realm, leaning on free open
            source software and using cyberspace as a free publishing framework, subverted the editorial design’s
            production chain and provided new perspectives in these fields (Free).<br><br>
            By exploring the three axes—Access-Community-Free—this program seeks to demonstrate how graphic designers
            can reclaim independence from the dominance of giant tech infrastructures, differentiate their work from
            established dynamics, and shift their practice towards a more inclusive and responsible design. The
            program
            underscores the critical importance of accessibility and democratization and the emergence of hybrid and
            participatory processes in challenging traditional design methodologies.

          <i>A New New Program for Graphic Design</i> aims to challenge traditional Western art and design education
          and
          empower graphic designers to ask critical questions about their practice and approach creation from a new
          perspective.<br>
          Proposed to anyone practicing—or interested in—graphic design (graphic designers, art directors, interactive
          designers, or “simply” designers), the program wants to challenge standardized design aesthetics, and it
          does so by providing designers with the critical tools and knowledge necessary to question their
          working methodology and the tools employed in their practice. The program focuses on soft skills, critical
          thinking, and values rather than hard and technical skills.<br>
          The program also emphasizes the importance of reappropriating tools and, thus, the design practice, seeking
          to expand the range of graphic design aesthetics.<br>
          Finally, by exploring new forms of education that are more open and available, with less hierarchical and
          more collaborative and networked methodologies, the program implements values of flexibility and inclusion

          <b>Description:</b><br>
          This laboratory explores the potential of digital fabrication and 3D modeling to broaden the creative
          process and democratize design practice. Drawing inspiration from free open source and Do It Yourself (DIY)
          cultures, we employ unconventional methodologies that integrate analog, digital, and computational tools to
          foster hybrid practices that challenge standardized design aesthetics.
          The lab places significant importance on combining new technologies with traditional techniques, and we
          encourage "hacking" as a means to push the participants out of their comfort zones and foster
          experimentation.
          By questioning contemporary design processes and tools, we strive to cultivate a more inclusive and diverse
          design culture, and we encourage re-appropriating creative tools to ensure that the design process remains
          accessible, affordable, and open to all.
          Through a series of exercises, participants will have the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities such
          as using drawing machines to engrave plates for offset printing, employing 3D modeling and printing to
          produce letterpress elements, utilizing CNC and laser cutters to build portable printing devices.<br><br>

          <b>Description:</b><br>
          The participants of this lab are invited to explore creative coding as a medium for unlocking their
          creativity
          and embracing a vast range of aesthetic possibilities. Through generative design, participants will learn
          how
          to create flexible and generative identities that allow for a multitude of visual expressions, reflecting
          the
          unique nature of each individual within a community.
          The shift from the traditional pursuit of "universal design" to a focus on "individuality" recognizes
          generative design as a valid approach that prioritizes the "multiple" over the "universal." This design
          philosophy promotes inclusivity while challenging the standardizations imposed by established design
          cultures.
          Developing projects such as generative identities, logo generators, and non-contextual texts, students will
          engage with creative coding using programming languages such as (but not limited to) p5.js and its
          libraries.
          Through this process, they will gain a deeper understanding of the potential of code to expand the
          boundaries
          of creation and express individuality in innovative and dynamic ways.<br><br>

          <b>Description:</b><br>
          This lab offers an opportunity for participants to critically examine the potential of the web as a platform
          for free publication and distribution. By engaging in hands-on projects centered on HTML/CSS-to-Print
          methodologies, the participants will learn how to extract their work from the dominant forces of production
          monopolized by technological infrastructures. This lab aims to raise awareness and prompt us to consider the
          ethical implications of these power dynamics.
          Throughout the course, we will explore the complex relationship between technology and society and how
          technological advancements have contributed to the monopolization of knowledge production. The lab provides
          a
          space for participants to consider alternatives to these dominant models.
          Through theoretical readings, technical demonstrations, and practical projects, we will develop the skills
          and
          critical awareness needed to navigate the contemporary landscape of digital publication and distribution. By
          the end of the course, we will have a thorough understanding of the potential of web-based platforms and the
          tools necessary to harness this potential for ethical and equitable knowledge production.<br><br>

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          Below are presented some of the results of the activation of each Labs within the program.

          <h2>Mobile Uno (Access)</h2>
          Mobile Uno explores the intersection of digital fabrication tools and traditional design forms. Inspired by
          the A23D font by New North Press, the project merges typography with 3D modeling and printing. The alphabet
          Mobile Uno was designed with the proportions of Le Corbusier's Modulor and used as the main component of the
          identity of furniture pieces with the same proportions’ framework. Initially, 3D-printed artifacts were
          crafted to serve as printing tools. Printing tests were conducted with an etching press, simulating
          letterpress typographical compositions using a cardboard laser-cut frame. The final prototype was composed
          of
          nine letters, composing the words "mobile uno" framed in one squared cardboard support, used to assist the
          pressing process. The experimentations included developing letterpress characters using 3D printing, laser
          cutting letter stencils in Plexiglas, developing mono-print tiles, modular tiles laser cut for custom
          mono-prints or embossing, and plotted masks for silk screen frames.

          <h2>Amaze (Community)</h2>
          The cinquain Amaze by Adelaide Crapsey is reimagined through a program written in JavaScript using Rita.js.
          Drawing from the extensive RiTa Lexicon, the program replaces verbs with other verbs and nouns with other
          nouns, creating a seemingly endless array of iterations of the five-line poem. This results in a unique
          version of the poem each time the webpage where the poem is displayed is refreshed. Finally, the resulting
          text is printed using a thermal printer and presented or distributed to the audience.
          Using programming and open-source software, this project challenges the traditional boundaries of poetry,
          showcasing the endless possibilities that technology offers to contemporary poetry. As each iteration is
          unique, the project encourages the audience to engage with the text and consider how language can be
          manipulated and transformed through digital means.
          Overall, this project questions the intersection of technology and art, offering a new perspective on poetry
          and how it can be produced and distributed in the modern era.

          <h2>Nos Beaux Arts (Free)</h2>
          This project aims to explore alternative methods of publishing and distributing content, which serve as a
          countermeasure to the monopolistic hold of large software infrastructures. To achieve this objective, the
          project employs the web as a free open platform that fosters independence.
          The publication prototype is developed using HTML and CSS programming, utilizing a Web-to-Print template
          (designed by Julie Blanc and implemented with paged.js). Exported as a PDF, and opened in Inkscape, a vector
          graphics editor, it is ultimately printed using an Axidraw, a versatile pen plotter.
          In a second step of the process, the production is scaled up from single prints to multiple prints through
          the
          craft of "master plates" incorporating, thus, Offset or Riso printing processes in the production workflow.
          This project seeks to broaden the horizons of traditional publishing and distribution methods through
          unconventional techniques, offering new possibilities for independent publishing.

          <h1>Notes About Our Values</h1>
          If you are interested in utilizing or drawing inspiration from this program, we kindly ask you to 
          support the following.<br><br>

          <h2>Openness and Freedom</h2>
          Relying on the free open source culture, this program is open and free. You are welcome to use it in any
          way,
          whether copying, changing, taking the entire program, or only a portion of it. You can also use it as
          inspiration for your work or rewrite and mix it with other materials.
          As it is a community-based initiative, we encourage you to contribute to its growth. We believe that sharing
          knowledge and resources can create something valuable and impactful. If you have any ideas or suggestions
          for
          improving the program, please don’t hesitate to share them with us.<br><br>

          <h2>About Flexibility</h2>
          Flexibility is a fundamental aspect of this program and a key concept. The program is designed to be
          adaptable
          and versatile, offering various formats such as a one-year program, a master’s program in an educational
          institution, or an independent short intensive program. Each lab within the program can also function as an
          independent module and be developed into a course or a workshop.
          Furthermore, “flexibility” stands as an alternative approach to “radicality.” This approach does not pass
          judgment or reject work produced within the framework of traditional practices and tools. Instead, it seeks
          to
          offer an alternative perspective on how design is approached and executed.<br><br>

          <h2>Inclusion and Respect</h2>
          In the classroom, we will work together to offer each community member a free, safe, and welcoming
          environment. We will create an inclusive space respecting and embracing the singularities of each member,
          celebrating our diversity, and respectfully accepting and including our different experiences, background,
          understanding, expressions, and abilities. We will work together to understand and stand against any form of
          discrimination and oppression and empower each community member to express any discomfort they might
          encounter
          in the classroom: together, we will solve it.
