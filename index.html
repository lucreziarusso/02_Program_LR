        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        This thesis is a concise (and non-exhaustive) synthesis of a decade of observations. Since 2010, when I
        accidentally bumped into Kevin Donnot’s article “Code = design,” the interest and attraction towards
        Processing
        and its community have never weakened. I was hooked then; I am still in awe now. The growth and evolution of
        Processing’s community was a constant source of inspiration and guided me in searching for a meaningful stance
        as a graphic designer and educator. Constantly questioning and readjusting their trajectory, they have never
        ceased to be a guiding light. Despite not being a coder, I never felt apart from their community, always
        sharing
        their values and ambitions. This text is my way to show my gratitude, offering my perspective on Processing’s
        exceptional contribution in shaping contemporary design practice.<br><br>
        This achievement wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance of my thesis advisor Pauline
        Chasseray-Peraldi: her enlightened perspective, thorough feedback, and rigorous gaze helped me apprehend the
        beauty of transdisciplinary research, giving me the keys to translating through text what I usually express
        visually. A big thank you goes to my instructor Lisa Salamandra, for her infinite patience and support and for
        giving me the tools to embrace academic writing as an empowering practice—even if, sometimes, it felt like an
        excruciating process. I also want to thank Klaus Fruchtnis, Linda Jarvin, and Paris College of Art for the
        opportunity of participating in this Master.<br><br>
        This thesis wouldn’t have existed without the help of my friends and colleagues. To my classmates Alicia,
        Anita,
        Laura, Porus, and Tara—companions throughout our mutual struggles, frustrations, and final accomplishments—a
        big
        thank you for making this journey a bit lighter. Congratulations on your achievements. To Spencer Kehe, Max
        Franklin, Tara Bogart, Gökçe Taskan, Filipa Cruz, Barbara Montefalcone, and Alix de Mercey: thank you for
        perpetually listening, unconditionally supporting, constantly questioning, sometimes doubting, and often
        tolerating: your support has kept me on track. A very big thank you to Véronique Vienne for being my constant
        inspiration.<br><br>
        Finally, I want to thank warmly Dorothy Santos and Dan Shiffman for their incredible generosity in offering
        their time to discuss Processing, coding, and education; and Casey Reas and Lauren McCarthy for pointing my
        research in the right direction. I hope that this text will highlight the relevance of their work and join
        further conversations about the intersections of art, design, technology, and education.

        This thesis analyzes how the free open source culture has, over the last two decades, reshaped the graphic
        design practice and redefined the contemporary graphic designer’s position. After having contextualized and
        juxtaposed the start-up and the free open source cultures, this research investigates how Processing, coding
        language and programming environment, has contributed to the reappropriation of creative tools and fostered a
        radical stance against the commodification of design culture imposed by tech monopolies. Giving new meaning to
        the expression “open source,” the project Processing has promoted accessibility and decentralized
        collaboration,
        expanding these concepts to fields beyond software development.
        Since its first release in 2001, Processing shifted from being a creative platform towards representing a
        system
        of values, and its influence on design and designers has immensely contributed to the emergence of new
        patterns
        in the graphic design field. Driven by Processing’s core values—access, community, free—graphic design has
        acquired a social and political dimension. In addition to distancing their productions from standardized
        esthetics through the reappropriation of their creative tools, graphic designers have revealed alternative
        methodologies that encompass values of accessibility and inclusion as a critical part of their work. These
        methodologies, including the hybridization of production tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory
        generative design, and the use of cyberspace as a free framework, became valid propositions for a practice
        renewal based on responsibility and flexibility.

          <div class="twoCol">
            Over the last three decades, the exponential development of technology has impacted all creative practices
            and
            has radically changed graphic design perspectives. The revolution brought about by the rise of the
            personal
            computer, particularly the release of the first Macintosh in 1984, created new opportunities for graphic
            design
            research and production, opening the path to methodological and esthetical experimentations. Nevertheless,
            the
            transition between the two centuries marked a pivot and revealed the exhaustion of that momentum, which
            mutated
            into a manifest crisis of creative methodologies. Companies like Apple, Adobe, and, years later, Google
            have
            been the driving force behind the technological revolution in design. However, in their effort to provide
            access
            to easy-to-use computers, interfaces, and tools, they have participated in the standardization of design
            esthetics, and fostered the commodification of design culture instead of its democratization.<br>
            In 2012, Kevin Donnot published the article “Code = design,”<span class="fnnum">[1]</span> an excerpt of
            his
            master’s thesis “<i>Outils
              numériques et design graphique</i>” (Digital Tools and Graphic Design). The essay questions the tools
            largely
            employed in the graphic design practice and, by extension, the practice itself. Restrained by the
            limitations
            of
            the massified software and submitted to the monopolization of devices that occurred in the early 2000s,
            the
            graphic designer must reclaim, Donnot stated, his status as a craftsperson and reappropriate the tools of
            creation.<span class="fnnum">[2]</span> Indeed, the standardization of the tools would translate to a
            normalization of graphic production and
            its esthetic.<span class="fnnum">[3]</span> To foster originality the graphic designer must become the
            maker
            of the creative tools.
            Programming and free software seem a possible alternative to reclaim this active role: “The interest of
            the
            free
            software [is that] the designer can integrate new functions and, above all, understand how the software
            works.
            Then, s/he is not lowered to a role of ‘user’ or ‘consumer’ and condemned to technical passivity. S/he
            moves
            from the status of consumer to the one of creator.”<span class="fnnum">[4]</span>
            Ten years after its release, Donnot mentioned Processing as being one of the programming languages and
            environments, within the free software movement, which represented an interesting alternative for graphic
            design: “The software proposes a new space for visual experimentation where the design is controlled by
            code.
            […] This alternative approach implies alternative creative processes and, therefore, alternative graphical
            propositions.”<span class="fnnum">[5]</span> Finally, Processing had crossed the Atlantic and was
            recognized
            as ambassador of the free and
            open source software movement, and as legitimate tool for the graphic design practice.<br><br>

            Conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Casey Reas and Ben Fry and built on the
            shoulders of prestigious predecessors such as Muriel Cooper and John Maeda, the first version of
            Processing
            was
            released in 2001. An easy-to-use, accessible coding language and programming environment, Processing was
            created
            to provide an educational tool for learning the graphic design principles, such as color and composition,
            through the medium of computation.<span class="fnnum">[6]</span> Intended for artists and designers, Reas
            and
            Fry’s proposition fostered the
            idea of “learning to create software” as opposed to “learning to use software,” suggesting a practical
            solution
            to the crisis of design methodologies of the late 1990s.<span class="fnnum">[7]</span> From the onset,
            Processing was quickly adopted by
            professionals who embraced its potential as a modular, expandable, and customizable kit.<span
              class="fnnum">[8]</span> Its auto-productive
            methodology echoed Do It Yourself (DIY) and hackers’ approaches and it opened the path to a renewal of the
            crafts in the design practice, resulting in a hybridization of analog and digital methods of
            productions.<br>
            Nevertheless, the core idea of Processing is even more radical, and its moral extent that “emerged within
            the
            culture of free software”<span class="fnnum">[9]</span> defines its approach and “differentiates [it] from
            proprietary, consumer-driven
            software.” Processing stands alongside the free/libre and open source software ideology and promotes the
            ideas
            of freedom and accessibility as essential. This position distances the project from purely esthetic
            considerations, adding a moral dimension in extending methodology to ideology. In the last decade, a
            community
            has grown. The work done by the community has provided new meanings to the expression “open source,” and
            has
            fostered a new vision of shared and decentralized collaboration, in fields that not only deal with
            software
            development.<br><br>

            Within this context, this thesis investigates, through the prism of graphic design, how Processing and the
            community built around it have transformed the design field and influenced the current generation of
            designers.
            Providing new perspectives to expand creativity and stand against the normalization of design imposed by
            design
            monopolies, Processing can be considered a pivot, this research postulates, in the dialectic opposition
            between
            the free open source and the start-up cultures, both interlaced within the graphic design field.
            The first chapter defines and contextualizes the opposition between start-up and free open source
            cultures,
            which arose in Silicon Valley and MIT between the 1970s and the beginning of the new century. The analysis
            of
            cases such as Apple Computer, Adobe Systems, and Google Design exemplifies the paradox of the start-up
            model,
            highlighting its metamorphosis from a counterculture into a monopoly. The review of core texts by the
            leading
            actors of the hacker, free software, and open source movements clarifies the misconception of free and
            open
            source culture and recognizes Processing as an advocate for a free and decentralized approach.
            The second part of this research focuses on Processing and the community developed around it over the last
            twenty years. From Muriel Cooper and John Maeda to Casey Reas and Ben Fry, this chapter first describes
            Processing’s origins at MIT. By analyzing the platform’s main components—language, environment,
            community—the
            chapter examines how Processing has expanded the concept of accessibility, questioning its economic,
            social,
            and
            political aspects, and has fostered values of inclusion as a critical part of the project.
            Finally, this research describes in its third chapter how the free open source culture and the system of
            values
            fostered by Processing influenced contemporary designers, contributing to the emergence of new patterns in
            the
            graphic design field. Through the reappropriation of the creative tools, contemporary designers distance
            their
            productions from standardized esthetics and reveal alternative methodologies that encompass values of
            accessibility and inclusion as a central part of their work. These methodologies, including the
            hybridization
            of
            production tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory generative design, and the use of cyberspace as
            a
            free
            framework, are valid propositions for a practice renewal based on responsibility and flexibility.
            To solve the perpetual struggle of graphic designers’ position, often tugged between radical
            polarities—design
            research on one side and design industry on the other—this thesis highlights alternative perspectives
            encompassing the acceptance of the profession’s paradox and the awareness of the designers’ responsibility
            in
            contemporary society.

          Graphic Design history cannot be dissociated from the technological evolution of tools: from the invention
          of
          the movable-type printing press, that shaped a new relationship to alphabets and, therefore, to
          typography,
          till
          the creation of the offset printing or the photocopy machine, which liberated the production and
          distribution
          of
          artist books and fanzines, new design esthetics and methodologies have always been empowered by new
          technological devices.
          Computational machines, the precursors of personal computers, joined the list of tools that have informed
          and
          reformed the way artists and designers conceived and produced images. By the 1970s, we observed a rising
          interest in merging art and mathematics through the medium of computation. Artists such as Vera Molnár,
          Manfred
          Mohr, and Frieder Nake pioneered the exploration of algorithmic thinking as a practical methodology for
          the
          arts. In a recent interview, Vera Molnár reiterated her approach: “In order to detect this extraordinary
          moment
          when the art arises, we do not have enough time and strength to craft it. It would mean to make millions
          and
          billions of variations. […] Here, you have a slave that follows your wishes. [The computer] allows you to
          materialize very quickly your visual thoughts which you could not have created because of lack of time or
          strength, or visual acuteness.”<span class="fnnum">[10]</span> Working with computation, Molnár pursued a
          part
          of the research developed by
          artists like Sol Lewitt, based on conceiving instructions to create a work of art. Giving instructions to
          the
          machine through code and randomizing some variables, she was, therefore, expanding intuition and enriching
          her
          senses: “There is a thing that can replace intuition. It’s randomness. Because […] it will show you
          billions
          of
          possibilities of which, with your limited imagination, you could not have thought of.”<span
            class="fnnum">[11]</span>
          The concept of expanding the potential of creation, using computers and code, is not limited to this
          radical
          artistic research. Mirroring the <i>niche</i> of computational art, the graphic design scene of central
          Europe
          of
          the
          1960s developed design research that explored the potential of computation. Karl Gerstner, a prominent
          figure
          of the Swiss graphic design scene of post-WWII, was one of the first graphic designers who foresaw the
          opportunities brought by computers for a rational and functional graphic design production. In 1963, he
          published <i>Designing Programmes</i>, in which he compiled his efforts for automatizing processes and
          applying
          scientific methodologies to design. The designer needed a set of rules to select and arrange the different
          design components (typography, images, color). The computer could help create systems that enlarge the
          range
          of solutions, within which the designer could identify the best one.<span class="fnnum">[12]</span>
          If the work of Gerstner or Molnár was situated at a time when computational machines were essentially
          accessible for scientific or military research, the release of the first Macintosh in 1984 was a pivot
          towards
          the extension of access to computers for graphic designers, and, in the following years, for a bigger
          audience.
          The American graphic designer April Greiman—who did part of her studies in Basel in the 1970s and was
          immersed
          in the swiss graphic design approach—was one of the first designers to openly embrace the opportunities
          created by the Macintosh. Interviewed by the magazine <i>Emigre</i> in 1988, she echoed Vera Molnár: “What I
          experience is rather than just doing something quickly, we’re looking at more possibilities. Instead of
          doing
          more work, we are seeing more options. […] With the Mac, once the information is stored, you can just look
          at
          seventy-two thousand variations. And then the accidents happen, and you say, ‘Oh that’s so much better,
          why
          don’t you go that way?’”<span class="fnnum">[13]</span>
          The iteration of graphic results offered by the machine was promoted as a sustainable methodology for
          design.
          Furthermore, Greiman adopted the esthetical language of the computer as a

          expression: the pixel, the raster of the screen, transparency and superposition, as well as the
          simultaneous
          presence of visual elements became core elements of her production. These new esthetics could, according
          to
          Greiman, empower personal and collective manifestation: “Everybody is visual; it’s in the collective soul,
          and
          the Mac will empower and help a lot of these people to express themselves. I like the idea that so many
          people
          will have a common language […] And this tool has its own language!”<span class="fnnum">[14]</span>
          Despite this optimistic vision, we witnessed, starting the mid-1990s, a slow but consistent shift towards
          a
          different use of the computer. If it was true that in the late 1980s computers were considered tools
          submitted
          to human beings to expand perception and production, during the following decade this trend faded away. In
          the
          early 2000s, it resulted in the massification of visual language’s esthetics due to a standardization of
          the
          tools and, therefore, of the graphic design practice.
          So, what happened between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 2000s? What were the reasons for
          the
          shift of the graphic design practice towards standardized methodologies? Radical design research based on
          the
          exploration of computer depth through the medium of computation was still pursued in institutions such as
          MIT.
          Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the professional graphic design field was deeply impacted by the rise of the
          “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get” (WYSIWYG)<span class="fnnum">[15]</span> interfaces that became popular as
          a
          way of emancipating oneself
          from
          the required understanding of the machine to be able to make design, allowing a more intuitive approach to
          graphic composition. Two opposite approaches developed in parallel and drew the main characteristics of
          what
          this thesis has defined as “start-up and free open source cultures.” In the following sections, we clarify
          their origins and highlight their radical opposition that resulted, at the very beginning of twenty-first
          century, with the birth of Processing.

          <h2>1.1 From Counterculture to Monopoly: A Silicon Valley Story</h2>
          Narrowing down the geographical context in which the technological evolution of the end of the twentieth
          century occurred, we observe that devices and programs massively employed, on a worldwide scale, for
          graphic
          design production were created in the Silicon Valley. The binomial Apple Computer and Adobe Systems
          intersected in this economic region located in Northern California in the United States. <span
            class="fnnum">[16]</span> This region,
          pervaded
          by the “Californian Ideology,” represented the biggest cultural paradox of modern history, and the
          contemporary design’s culture has been molded mirroring this paradox.

          <p class="quote">The Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies
            and
            the
            entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies. This amalgamation of opposites has been achieved through a profound
            faith
            in the emancipatory potential of the new information technologies. In the digital utopia, everybody will
            be
            both hip and rich. Not surprisingly, this optimistic vision of the future has been enthusiastically
            embraced
            by computer nerds, slacker students, innovative capitalists, social activists, trendy academics,

          In the transition from the Industrial into the Knowledge Age,<span class="fnnum">[18]</span> cyberspace,
          the
          internet, and computers were
          seen as tools for emancipation from the established power and hierarchy. Colonizing this new immaterial
          space
          is an exciting opportunity for freedom and liberation. The Californian counterculture of the 1960s was
          reshaped, during the following decades, into a paradoxical ideology connecting two opposite but equally
          powerful aspirations: the collective adventure enabled by the new reach of global communications and a
          complete professional autonomy thriving on personal success.<span class="fnnum">[19]</span> Marshall

          start-up culture which, in the name
          of
          innovation, does not perceive, or refuse to admit, the discrepancies of its economic model.

          of the twentieth century, cyberspace is still a place where market regulations
          are inapplicable or unapplied. Therefore, we witnessed the surge of contrasting visions for the possible
          missions of the internet. The philosophy of the free exchange of knowledge—brought about by activists such
          as
          Aaron Swartz—which fosters openness and collaboration, sets aside the liberal ideal of the conquest of
          cyberspace as a new market, denying any empathy or collaborative spirit, and promoting one’s personal
          success
          at any price.<span class="fnnum">[22]</span>
          The aftermath of this paradoxical conjunction was the advent of start-ups companies born as opponents of
          powerful economic giants that have metamorphosized into giant infrastructures. Apple Computer and Adobe
          Systems—companies hardly avoidable in the professional graphic design field—are striking examples. Both
          corporations initially thriving for innovation with the mission of offering technological autonomy to
          their
          customers, have progressively been transformed into market dominators, forbidding any emancipation from
          their
          products.


          <h3>1.1.1 Apple Computer</h3>
          Invited by the TV show <i>The Computer Chronicles</i>, “icon designer” Susan Kare and Product Design Manager
          Jerry
          Manock presented, in 1985, the newly released Apple computer. Ergonomically studied to be light, portable,
          and
          user-friendly, the Macintosh was designed to be used by the “99th percentile of males, females, and
          children,”
          Maddock stated.<span class="fnnum">[23]</span> Developed to allow comprehensive accessibility, the
          interface
          system and icons were created
          to
          be clearly and quickly understood and assimilated. Susan Kare shared during the interview that “one of the
          best experiences,” was how to easily teach in roughly twenty minutes to use the Macintosh to those who
          have
          never used a computer before. This was made possible because the function of each icon does not need
          additional verbal explanation.<span class="fnnum">[24]</span> Interface and object’s ergonomics translated
          into reality what Steve Jobs
          foresaw few years earlier: “bringing computers to the people, with the cheerful but affordable design of
          an
          Eichler home and the ease of use of a sleek kitchen appliance.”<span class="fnnum">[25]</span>
          It is paramount to remember that, considering the historical and geographical context in which the
          Macintosh
          was conceived, its design was inherently western centered. With its focus positioned on the wealthy
          majority,
          Apple partially ignored any inclusive design principle devoted to minorities or “special people,”<span
            class="fnnum">[26]</span>
          fundamentals
          outlined, a few years later, by Don Norman in his <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>. Nevertheless,
          “accessibility”
          and “affordability” were at the center of Apple’s communication. The seeds of Apple’s worldwide triumph of
          the
          following decades were grounded in these few concepts, as well as its paradox.
          Describing the interface, Susan Kare highlighted the similarities between Macintosh icons and daily life
          objects: the interface mimicked the interactions with our surroundings. We could easily recognize a
          “document”
          that we organized in a “folder.” If we saw clock hands turning, we could understand that we had to wait
          for
          time to pass. We calculated simple operations with a pocket calculator, and we put it in the trash can
          documents that we wanted to throw away.

          Since the creation of the personal computer, this intuitive strategy for computer interaction was
          groundbreaking, emancipating users from the need for a deep understanding of inherent machine language.
          The
          space between the human being and the machine was now inhabited by an interface that functioned as a
          translator. Interface design, thus, became strategic.

          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">The concept [of the interface] lies across a critical boundary—between material and
            immaterial reality. […]
            interface is also the immaterial meeting place between two states of reality, previously extraneous,
            that
            merge to exchange information, to interact. […] Around the concept of the interface, the relationship
            between
            man and machine calls up the problem of access—man must have access to the machine, and the machine must
            have
            access to the men, in a process that aims at attaining specific objectives.<span class="fnnum">[27]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          The “specific objective” was evidently to facilitate the use of the machine, yet in a consumerist-driven
          effort to conquer a new market. Here resided the paradox: in the trajectory towards innovative
          accessibility,
          tech corporations have interposed an interface between the human and the

          machine which, while facilitating
          comprehension of the functions, undermined the user’s personal responsibility of understanding, and
          learning
          the machine’s language. The result was users’ lack of autonomy, with a consequent submission and
          dependence
          on
          technology. The accessibility, presented as a pedagogical gesture to emancipate users from the computer’s
          complexity, resulted instead in their disempowerment. The pedagogical preoccupation was thus solely to
          educate
          a bigger audience, with the objective of attracting customers.
          Observing the evolution of Apple’s interfaces from its early stages till the beginning of the 2000s, we
          recognize a development towards a skeuomorphic visual language that brought, in parallel, a progressive
          closure of the operating system. Although Apple’s first Macintosh, included a “program to make programs”
          such
          as HyperCard which allowed its users to actively engage with the computer, this interactivity has become
          increasingly less accessible in newer machines. With the release of macOS X, the customization of graphic
          software through the installation of plug-ins became almost a quest. The fast, powerful, and fancy Apple
          computers of the beginning of the new century almost completely lost their modularity and customizability.
          Despite mimicking a three-dimensional space, their interfaces induced, instead, a linear and flat use of
          the
          device, preventing any in-depth interaction.

          <h3>1.1.2 Adobe Systems</h3>
          Founded in 1982, Adobe (originally Adobe Systems) has been Apple’s entrepreneurial companion from its
          early
          stages. From creating the Postscript printing protocol, which allowed Apple to succeed in the desktop
          publishing industry, to developing the early versions of Illustrator for the Macintosh environment only,
          Adobe
          has been Apple’s wing person in its entrepreneurial journey.
          Adobe’s founders John Warnock and Charles Geschke shared the story and philosophy of the company during
          its
          twentieth-anniversary celebration in 2002. Grounded in the Silicon Valley ideology, Adobe echoes the
          entrepreneurial vision of the start-up culture. At a time, in the early 1980s, in which the desktop
          printing
          market—the first territory of their intervention—was not yet defined or understood, Adobe has always
          thrived
          on innovation, focusing their efforts on groundbreaking products, designed to anticipate trends and
          market’s
          demands.<span class="fnnum">[28]</span> The advent of the PostScript protocol, Adobe’s first product and
          precursor of the open and standard
          PDF format, marked a new printing revolution. Bridging the screen and the paper—the “what-you-see” to the
          “what-you-get”—the PostScript language, implemented in the LaserWriter produced by Apple, profoundly
          reformed
          the graphic design industry, joining the immateriality of the screen to the materiality of the page and
          showing a concrete use of the computer to create graphics that could be converted in a quality tangible
          output.
          During the conference “Adobe Systems: The Founder’s Perspective,” Geschke addressed the two main points of
          Adobe’s philosophy of the time: “Everybody should have their own computer. […] A computer is not primarily
          used to calculate; it’s used to communicate.”<span class="fnnum">[29]</span> Giving access to technology
          to a
          wider market remains, as for
          Apple, one of the initial preoccupations of the company. And giving them the opportunity to imagine a
          pragmatic use of the machine computer with the connection to a printer was a breakthrough. Nevertheless,
          from
          an entrepreneurial standpoint, diversifying their product was critical for the company’s survival.
          In 1986, Adobe released the first version of Adobe illustrator, betting on the new and unlikely graphic
          design
          field: apart from cutting-edge experimentations of the few, most of the graphic designers had not yet, at
          the
          time, appropriated and integrated the computer as a production device. Quickly, Adobe Photoshop joined its
          fellow Illustrator and, together, they started conquering designers’ fantasies. Selling the illusion of
          condensing, inside the computer box, and behind the screen, all graphical experimentations previously
          envisioned in the material realm, Adobe designated the computer as the new, compact, mono-tool for the
          visual
          arts.
          The expansion, during the 1990s, of graphic design programs undeniably empowered for a while the graphic
          design production pushing further the postmodernist experimentations like those initiated by designers
          such
          as
          the

          Swiss Wolfgang Weingart. The binomial computer/software allowed to de-structure, decompose, recompose,
          and
          reimagine elements (typography, grids, and layout) in newer, faster, easier, unexpected ways, contributing
          to
          establishing a different temporality for the projects and reforming the design process. The work of
          designers
          like David Carson, Neville Brody, or Rudy VanderLans, and Zuzana Licko exploited these new frontiers and
          pushed the boundaries of their research focused on hybrid forms on the edge between traditional and
          unconventional design: “We both [VanderLans and Licko], each in our own way, really enjoyed this machine.
          It
          forced us to question everything we had learnt about design. We both enjoyed that process of exploration,
          of
          how far you could push the limits.”<span class="fnnum">[30]</span>
          At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the major success of their products led Adobe to progress
          exponentially. Expanding the offer and acquiring competitors’ products and companies, the
          corporation-to-be
          set a new trajectory for conquering the market—a market they helped define—and assembled an entire armada
          of
          design programs. These years marked a pivot, shifting Adobe from a dynamic start-up that injected new
          perspectives for the design practice to a colossal infrastructure dominating the graphic design
          production.
          The visual excitement of the 1990s faded away, replaced by the feeling of being trapped in a conventional
          and
          expensive “golden cage,” with no possibility of expression out of the standardized path drawn by Adobe’s
          programs and interfaces.
          <br><br>
          Over time, Adobe's interfaces have developed the same inherent structure, offering a global, consistent,
          and
          comforting environment for their users. Enabled to quickly recognize the graphic setting of the programs
          and
          easily appropriate the new functionalities, users felt in control of the workflow. However, the comfort of
          a
          recognizable interface generated a standardization of the esthetics of graphic design productions and a
          conformity in the methodological patters of creation. Employing the same tools, with the same interfaces,
          engendered the harmonization of the mechanical gestures and behaviors during the design process.
          Furthermore,
          the acceleration of the temporality of production, caused by a hyper-consumerist market, encouraged the
          designers to take advantage of the comfort of Adobe’s environment, and prevented any further design
          exploration of forms or tools.
          The conformity of design esthetics engendered by the standardization of the design tools is critical.
          However,
          to better frame the implication of Adobe becoming a monopoly, the question of affordability, and thus of
          accessibility, is crucial. Since the release of the first programs, the cost of the products has been
          prohibitive for most visual artists and designers, rejecting the economic minorities from the profession.
          Being a graphic designer was (and still is) a privilege, as it implies having the capacity of buying a
          computer (Apple) and the programs (Adobe for the most part) needed to create artwork. An underground
          market
          of
          cracked software provided, for years, the solution for some designers to start their activity until, in
          2013,
          Adobe moved to a subscription-only model, removing any standalone versions. The customers are not the
          owners
          of the programs they use, and they pay a monthly subscription to access them. If the subscription model
          can
          be
          legitimate for commodities such as video on demand, the model becomes questionable when applied to
          professional tools required for working.
          In October 2019, Adobe temporarily blocked the access to Venezuelan customers to their products and
          enabled
          their customers to access their work on the Creative Cloud. The decision came in conformity with the US
          government’s decision of prohibiting transactions and services between companies of the United States and
          Venezuela<span class="fnnum">[31]</span> and dramatically revealed the flaw of their subscription-only
          business model. After month of
          negotiations with the US government, Adobe was able to restore the Venezuelan customers’ access to the
          Cloud.
          Nevertheless, the incident revealed the fragility of designers’ freedom and independence from the Adobe’s
          monopoly, and shown some inconsistencies between the philosophy of the company and its actions:
          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">The other philosophy that we have internally […] in the way that our company should
            operate

          <h3>1.1.3 Google Design</h3>
          We have observed how Apple and Adobe contributed to creating and developing the computer and software
          market
          in the graphic design field. Providing tools which simplified the intellectual access to the computers,
          they
          have educated, during the years, designers as well as a broader audience, and enabled them to appropriate
          the
          computer—till that moment seen as a computational machine for calculations—as a tool for communication and
          visual creation.<span class="fnnum">[33]</span> Both Apple and Adobe’s efforts towards accessibility
          translated into creating environments
          and interfaces that were easy to use and understand. However, the temporary users’ understanding of the
          personal computer’s functions has metamorphosized into a lack of autonomy in front of the ever-changing
          technology. From the middle of the 1980s to the beginning of the 2000s, we witnessed the increase of the
          separation between the user and the computer, which concretized in the standardization of the design
          methodologies caused by the extended offer of programs relying on same interactive patterns.
          Google can be identified as the third actor that heavily contributed to the normalization of graphic
          design
          esthetics and methodologies. With the release of Google Fonts (originally Google Web Fonts), Google began
          a
          new business model for tech companies proposing free graphic design components distributed on the
          internet.
          This gesture towards a sharing strategy that echoes the open source model has democratized the access to
          design yet fostered the commodification of the design culture through the standardization of its
          esthetics.
          This event was critical in redefining the concept of accessibility. Google Font provided young designers
          and
          design students an affordable alternative to access, explore, and use typography; yet, it started
          colonizing
          the graphic design field, with professionals and agencies taking advantage of the easy-to-use and free
          offer,
          forgoing the singularity and uniqueness that typographers used to bring to each design project. In January
          2019, the branding agency <i>Carré Noir</i> redesigned the city of Paris’ logo and identity, using the font
          Montserrat as its main typeface—one of Google Font’s best sellers.<span class="fnnum">[34]</span>
          Is this business model a simple gesture to emancipate the users? The paradox of innovation of the start-up
          culture is still current. The shift toward a more open business model seems to benefit the tech
          corporation
          that, in providing commodities, retains its customers in its comforting cybercommunity. The complexity of
          defining “accessibility” is critical. Does Google’s “accessibility” mean providing access to products or
          providing tools for autonomy? Is accessibility equal to emancipation, or just another way to conquer the
          market?
          In 2015, Google released Material Design, a comprehensive catalog of design components to create
          interactive
          applications, and published the documentation and specs online as an open platform. Material Design was
          thought to give consistency to the interactive interfaces of Android products (Apple’s competitor). Giving
          open access to design tools with the mission of providing accessibility to a better design seemed
          innovative
          and far-sighted. If we watch the teaser <i>Making Material Design</i> published online for the release, we
          can
          identify some keywords such as “collaboration,” “community,” “experiment” that are repositioning the
          philosophy of Google towards a place close to the free open source approach.<span class="fnnum">[35]</span>
          The proposition is appealing. Nevertheless, the main consequences of Google’s proposition are the
          esthetical
          uniformity of interaction design products’, and the weakening of designers’ legitimacy as professional
          experts. Presenting the color palettes of Material Design, Google’s Senior Designer Rachel Been stated:
          “[with] this really simplified and easy-to-use system, […] someone who never took a color theory class
          could
          create a combination of colors within their products that felt harmonious.”<span class="fnnum">[36]</span>
          Google has drastically contributed to the commodification of design practice and culture, fostering an
          ideal
          of “universal design” open to

          everyone, for everyone, by everyone, dramatically undermining the importance

          of
          designing with a focus on singularities. Matias Duarte, Vice-President of Material Design, reiterated
          their
          ideal of proposing principles of design that “should be timeless” in order to achieve a universal
          framework.<span class="fnnum">[37]</span>
          The concepts of universality and accessibility are, thus, central to this thesis’ investigations.
          For years, the free open source culture’s communities have pursued a parallel path, observing the
          development
          of the tech giants and, sometimes, raising their voice to expose the injustices created by the new
          hierarchies
          they have put into place. Processing’s community has contributed the most to a critical approach to design
          aimed to empower the user instead of having them be submitted to a passive stance. Before diving into
          Processing’s story, the next section will retrace the path of the free open source culture and communities
          situating them historically and geographically.

          <br><br>
          <h2>1.2 From Hackers to FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software): A Moral Debate</h2>

          For years in the shadow, often misunderstood and stigmatized, the legacy inherited from programmers and
          software developers has tremendously influenced the approach fostered by the Processing community. Between
          the
          1960s and the 2000s, hacking, free software, and open source grew in parallel with the start-up culture,
          countering the capitalistic and consumer-driven orientation that was colonizing the field of software
          development at the time. Despite the fact that hackers and open source methodologies are now actively
          inspiring the contemporary design fields, the terminology referring to those cultures is often misused or,
          worse, misunderstood.
          To better frame the meaning of “free open source culture” employed in this research, this section analyzes
          some of the central texts that modeled the cultures of hackers, free software, and open source, and
          clarifies
          their terminology. Through the following literature review, this research retraces the path connecting the
          hackers’ ethics rooted in the MIT of the 1950s, through the open source methodology established in the
          late
          1990s, till the contemporary definition of FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software), and continues further
          to
          reveal the sour debate about the ethics of software development and distribution, that emerged at the end
          of
          the last century.

          <h3>1.2.1 Hackers: A Matter of Jargon</h3>
          Allison Parrish, programmer, artist, and educator introduced her opening keynote at the Open Hardware
          Summit
          2016 as following: “Every practice, whether technical or artistic, has a history and a culture, and you
          can’t
          understand the tools without understanding the culture and vice-versa. Computer programming is no
          different.
          […] Part of the challenge of teaching computer programming is making the history and culture available to
          my
          students so they can better understand the tools I’m teaching them to use.”<span class="fnnum">[38]</span>
          History and culture are
          inherently
          related to language and vocabulary. Parrish exemplifies this in her keynote, describing how, as a
          teenager,
          young programmer, and computer passionate, she relied on the software developer Eric S. Raymond’s “Jargon
          File” to feel like she belonged to “the glory days of hacking and the computer revolution.”<span
            class="fnnum">[39]</span> Born in 1981,
          she
          was too young to have lived the era, between the 1950s and the 1980s, during which hackers’ terminology
          and
          their values were rooted. She thus consciously adopted the “Jargon File” as her own culture.”<span
            class="fnnum">[40]</span>
          First published in the early 1990s, the informal web text the “Jargon File” is still considered one of the
          primary references to define hacker’s terminology. Raymond is one of the most influential and prolific
          theorists who thoroughly contributed to defining, promoting, and supporting the hacker’s community and the
          open source development model. In 1996, he published <i>How to Become a Hacker</i>: “As editor of the
          ‘Jargon
          File’
          and author of a few other well-known documents of similar nature, I often get email requests from
          enthusiastic
          network newbies asking (in effect) ‘how can I learn to be a wizardly hacker?’ Oddly enough there don’t
          seem
          to
          be any other FAQs or web documents that address this vital question, so here’s mine.”<span
            class="fnnum">[41]</span>
          What is a hacker, then?

          First, to demystify the communal belief about hackers, it is essential to make a
          clear
          distinction between the concept of “hackers” and the one of “crackers.”<span class="fnnum">[42]</span> The
          media have often wrongly
          depicted
          hackers as people employing their skills to steal credit card numbers or sell confidential information.
          But
          if
          we refer to hackers’ literature on the internet, we understand that this behavior is considered, by the
          hacker
          community itself, as “lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright.”<span class="fnnum">[43]</span> In <i>How to
            Become a Hacker</i>, Eric Raymond
          stated that “being able to break security doesn’t make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire
          cars
          makes you an automotive engineer. […] The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break
          them.”<span class="fnnum">[44]</span>
          A few years earlier, in 1984, writer and journalist Steven Levy published <i>Hackers. Heroes of the Computer
            Revolution</i>. Levy portraited the “the glory days of hacking and the computer revolution”<span
            class="fnnum">[45]</span> dreamed by Allison
          Parrish and retraced the origins of the term “hacker” and narrated the community’s early pranks in the
          rooms
          of MIT. In the preface to the 2010 edition, Levy stated:
          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">I was first drawn to writing about hackers—those computer programmers and designers who
            regard computing as the most important thing in the world—because they were such fascinating people.
            Though
            some in the field used the term “hacker” as a form of derision, implying that hackers were either nerdy
            social outcasts or “unprofessional” programmers who wrote dirty, “nonstandard” computer code, I found
            them
            quite different. Beneath their often unimposing exteriors, they were adventurers, visionaries,
            risk-takers,
            artists… and the ones who most clearly saw why the computer was a truly revolutionary tool. […] I came
            to
            understand why true hackers consider the term an appellation of honor rather than a pejorative.<span
              class="fnnum">[46]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          To restore that vision of the community, Levy listed the Hacker Ethic, a series of principles that are
          still
          claimed, by the contemporary programming community, as their foundation: unlimited access to computers,
          freedom of information, decentralization of power, and anti-academic position. Levy concluded the list
          with:
          “You can create art and beauty on a computer”<span class="fnnum">[47]</span> and “Computers can change
          your
          life for the better.”<span class="fnnum">[48]</span> Although
          certain aspects remain controversial, Levy’s Hacker Ethic still reflected the building blocks not only of
          the
          hacker culture, but of the communities that have been inspired by the free software and open source
          models.

          <h3>1.2.2 Open Source and Free Software: A Fracture</h3>
          Hackers’ approach, based on decentralization, collaboration, and free access to computers, programs, and
          information, continue to inspire parts of the contemporary design scene. Nevertheless, probably to
          distance
          themselves from a community too quickly stigmatized, the contemporary promoters of these principles prefer
          to
          define themselves as part of the open source movement.
          Over the last fifteen years, the term “open source” has increasingly gained notability, and its use has
          been
          “stretched [to] activities, such as government, education, and science, where there is no such thing as
          source
          code.”<span class="fnnum">[49]</span> The open source methodology is built on decentralization and
          collaboration; yet “open source” does
          not
          imply freedom of access, use, replication, and distribution.
          The arise of the term “open source” is inherently connected to Linus Torvalds’s lifetime work, the open
          source
          operating system Linux, still considered one of the “world’s largest collaborative projects.”<span
            class="fnnum">[50]</span> His work was
          an
          essential contribution in exposing the open source model—and in consequentially defining it—but also
          caused
          the fracture between the free software and the open source movements, in opposition about the ethics of
          software distribution. The story of Linux is summarized in Torvalds’s auto-biographical book <i>Just for
            Fun</i>.
          The
          Story of an Accidental Revolutionary. The book title alludes to Torvalds’s position regarding his work and
          the
          reasons for its success. Educated in Finland, a culture where “greediness was perceived as suspicious,”
          and
          raised by a “diehard communist father,”<span class="fnnum">[51]</span> Torvalds never thought of his work
          as
          commercially valuable. The
          intellectual aspect of it and the excitement of proposing a working piece of software were his driving
          forces.
          Sharing his code with others to collectively develop and solve problems simply seemed practical to him.
          His
          intention was not to

          create a worldwide example of collaborative work or to build his career. He made it
          Just
          for Fun, the result of an intellectual, not strictly commercial, vocation.
          Inspired by Linus Torvalds’s work, Eric Raymond wrote in the late 1990s, <i>The Cathedral & the Bazaar</i>,
          published
          in 2001. Central in defining the open-source methodology, Raymond’s essay theorized about the bazaar’s
          bottom-up methodology based on decentralization and collaboration and juxtaposed it to the cathedral’s
          top-down design, typical of traditional development models.<span class="fnnum">[52]</span> With the
          foundation
          in 1998 of the Open Source
          Initiative (OSI)<span class="fnnum">[51]</span>, Raymond distanced himself from the radical position of
          the
          Free Software Foundation,
          founded in 1986 and led by Richard Stallman:

          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">If [Stallman’s] rhetoric had been effective outside the hacker community, we’d have
            gotten
            where we are now five or ten years sooner, and OSI would have been completely unnecessary (and I could
            be
            writing code, which I’d much rather be doing than this...). […] So, when RMS insists that we talk about
            ‘computer users’ rights,’ he’s issuing a dangerously attractive invitation to us to repeat old failures.
            It’s one we should reject -- not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language,
            applied to software, simply does not persuade anybody but us. In fact, it confuses and repels most
            people
            outside our culture.<span class="fnnum">[54]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          Stallman clearly stated his disagreement with the Open Source Initiative in his critical text “Why Open
          Source
          Misses the Point of Free Software”:
          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">The terms ‘free software’ and ‘open source’ stand for almost the same range of programs.
            However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based on different values. The free
            software
            movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By
            contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles.
            This
            is why we do not agree with open source and do not use that term.<span class="fnnum">[55]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          If the debate is legitimate, paradoxically, Torvalds’s decentralized model did not have any ethical
          implications, <i>per se</i>. In his book <i>Just for Fun</i>, Torvalds distance himself from the moral
          debate
          between
          open
          source and free software, rejecting any label that Stallman or Raymond would put on him. He admits
          admiring
          and respecting both opponents but does not want to engage in the controversy.<span class="fnnum">[56]</span>
          The fracture between the open-source and free software ideologies (or rhetoric) is still a contemporary
          and
          relevant debate. Language often defines cultures and claiming to stand for the open source, or the free
          software model could have profound moral, ethical, and political implications.

          <h3>1.2.3 FLOS Software and FLOS Culture for the Visual Arts</h3>
          The controversy that emerged twenty years ago around software accessibility is still relevant and has
          infiltrated fields not explicitly connected to software development. The acronym FLOSS that stands for
          Free/Libre Open Source Software has been coined to partially “bridge the [free software and open source]
          communities and their differing opinions.”<span class="fnnum">[57]</span> Casey Reas, co-creator of the
          Processing environment, published
          in
          2017 the article “Processing and FLOSS,” which revamped the debate, extending it to the visual arts. It
          also
          served to clarify the Processing community’s moral position on this matter. He adopted a position of
          neutrality in front of the radical opposition of free software and open source, while underlining the
          Processing community’s commitment for accessibility and free (libre) exchange: “Many people in the Free
          Software community argue with people who promote Open-Source software about fundamental ideas and vice
          versa.
          […] The acronym FLOSS is sometimes used to bridge the communities and their differing opinions. The word
          <i>libre</i>
          is added to <i>free</i> to make the goal of ‘free as in freedom,’ the ideals of liberty, more clear.”<span
            class="fnnum">[58]</span>
          Reas refers to Stallman’s article “Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software,” and clarifies his
          position about software for the visual arts, reiterating the importance of the tools’ authorship, which
          allows
          to shape our work as we intend, without relying to corporations and ready-made platforms. He concludes:
          “We
          believe in the fundamental freedoms of Free Software and that is our path.”<span class="fnnum">[59]</span>

          moral commitment is crucial for the community
          which has developed around the Processing environment. The idea of a community fostering the principles of
          freedom and accessibility is an aspiration Reas reiterates in his “Thoughts on Software for the Visual
          Arts”:
          “I have seen independent creators build local and networked communities to share intellectual resources
          and
          tools. […] It’s an aspiration toward a way of making and sharing that has been strongest in one area of
          the
          visual arts, the world of creator-programmers. I want to try to scale it within that context and I also
          want
          to know if it’s applicable to other areas.”<span class="fnnum">[60]</span>
          Based on Reas’s postulate, we can legitimately use “free open source” to describe not only software
          programming but also cultures and communities built on the idea of decentralization, collaboration, and
          free
          access to information. If “free” is intended as “freedom” and “source” as “documentation,” it is possible
          to
          make the transition from “free open source software” to “free open source culture.”

          <h2>1.3 Conclusion: Joining the Dots</h2>
          Since the end of the twentieth century, Silicon Valley and its economic success have driven the
          imagination
          of
          young companies worldwide and have established new objectives for innovation in the economy of knowledge.
          The
          excitement of the new economic frontiers brought about by new technologies has shaped generations of young
          entrepreneurs, inspired by tech corporations’ pioneers like Steve Jobs: “We are inventing the future.
          Think
          about surfing on the front edge of a wave. It’s really exhilarating. […] Come down here and make a dent in
          the
          universe.”<span class="fnnum">[61]</span> Nevertheless, this optimistic vision has been recognized as a
          false
          promise. The hope of
          emancipation from the social and economic establishment brought about by computers and the internet has
          resulted in a re-centralization of the economic power in the tech giants’ hands. Technology is unavoidable
          and
          especially the technological infrastructures that have colonized cyberspace.
          Design practices have particularly suffered from this new paradigm: the professional graphic design market
          employing the tools offered by companies such as Apple and Adobe, struggled to find viable alternatives to
          their products. The monopolization of the tools for graphic design, in a pretended effort for universal
          accessibility—alas too often focused on the wealthy majority—have instead fostered progressive
          inaccessibility
          of the core of the technology itself, removing the necessity of learning the machine’s language, and
          trapping
          its users in a “golden cage.” This paradoxical situation has created a standardization of the production
          (the
          same tools produce the same esthetics) and, as Casey Reas highlighted in the CAST Symposium of 2017 “Being
          Material,”<span class="fnnum">[62]</span> it has generated the crisis of creative methodologies.
          Nevertheless, alternative production models emerged in the legacy of hackers and open source cultures. As
          the
          report or the Progress and Freedom Foundation foresaw in 1994, “It is clear […] that cyberspace will play
          an
          important role knitting together in the diverse communities of tomorrow, facilitating the creation of
          ‘electronic neighborhoods’ bound together not by geography but by shared interests.” <span
            class="fnnum">[63]</span> These communities
          brought
          together by the virtual space of the internet provided a new vision in the quest for alternatives to the
          centralized power, detached by consumerist ambitions and converging towards a radical exploration of new
          forms
          of production and distribution. The free and open source dynamics have inspired new designers and
          initiated
          their emancipation, concretized in the self-production of tools and in a revamping of social and political
          engagements.
          If we identify the Silicon Valley as the cradle of the start-up culture, the free open source culture’s
          would
          be MIT, where the roots of hackers and DIY cultures can be found. Towards the end of the twentieth
          century,
          compelling explorations emerged within this space for research, in the form of an in-depth investigation
          of
          the potentiality of new computational machines. MIT’s open and exploratory approach catalyzed designers,
          artists, and researchers who were looking for new, radical dynamics.
          It was in this context of experimental research and embracing the principles of the free open source
          culture
          rooted in cyberspace, that Processing set its moral

          Reas stated, “it accelerated the promise of more universal access to information, of creating new kinds of
          communities, and of breaking down hierarchies. These values are shared with the origins of
          Processing.”<span class="fnnum">[64]</span>
          Following the path of Muriel Cooper and John Maeda, and through the discovery of Casey Reas and Ben Fry’s
          work, the next chapter will reveal Processing’s origins and describes its evolution from a programming
          language to a community fostering diversity and inclusion.

            <p class="quote">It’s hard to pin down what Processing is, precisely. I admit, it can be confusing, but
              here
              it is: it’s
              both
              a programming environment and a programming language, but it’s also an approach to building a software
              tool
              that incorporates its community into the definition. It’s more accurate to call Processing a
              platform—a
              platform for experimentation, thinking, and learning. It’s a foundation and beginning more than a
              conclusion.<span class="fnnum">[65]</span>

            Processing is complex to define, and the risk of reducing it to a coding language would undermine its
            scope.
            The project’s complexity represents its richness and translates the multiplicity of influences and
            intents.
            In the first chapter, we exemplified how the triad “computer-software-internet” has been ruled by tech
            giants such as Apple, Adobe, and Google, and how these monopolies have chained graphic design
            professionals
            into closed workspaces, generating a standardization of the esthetics and a crisis in design
            methodologies.
            Processing’s proposition of “language-environment-community”<span class="fnnum">[66]</span> seems to
            provide
            alternatives to these
            dynamics
            and to reverse the paradigm of creation in the visual arts, allowing the designer to become the actor of
            a
            tool’s production and a work’s distribution.
            This chapter investigates the path that led to the birth of Processing and clarifies how its coding
            language
            and programming environment has evolved into a “platform,” inspiring artists and
            designers and empowering their practice. We first unveil the dialogue between Processing and its
            predecessors to show evidence of the tight connection with MIT and the graphic design practice. Through
            the
            analysis of the platform’s main components—language, environment, community—this chapter examines how
            Processing has expanded the concept of accessibility, questioning its economic, social, and political
            aspects, and has fostered values of inclusion as a critical part of the project.

            <br><br>
            <h2>2.1 MIT’s Heritage</h2>
            <p class="quote">Processing […] was born at the MIT Media Lab, a place where C. P. Snow’s two cultures
              (the
              humanities and the
              sciences) could synthesize. […] Processing wasn’t pulled from the air; it was deeply rooted in decades
              of
              prior work.<span class="fnnum">[67]</span>
              <br>— Casey Reas, “Thoughts on Software for the Visual Arts,” 2019.
            </p>
            <br>

            Processing’s complexity and relevance result from the combination of several influences, most of which
            are
            rooted at MIT. The connection between Processing and the free open source culture, also partially
            originated
            at MIT, was exemplified in the previous chapter: hackers, open source, and FLOSS approaches jointly
            informed
            Processing’s sharing model and initiated a new investigation about “accessibility.” Nevertheless, the
            thread
            connecting Processing to MIT consolidated between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s, when the MIT Media
            Lab,
            a
            space of groundbreaking experimental research, became the cradle of humanities and science’s
            conjunction.<span class="fnnum">[68]</span>
            Muriel Cooper’s Visual Language Workshop (VLW), followed by John Maeda’s Aesthetics and Computation
            Group
            (ACG), both part of the Media Lab, are undoubtedly the two laboratories that provided the building
            blocks of
            Processing’s platform.<span class="fnnum">[69]</span> Both Cooper’s interdisciplinary experimentation,
            informed by her graphic design
            background, and Maeda’s approach to code as a creative tool bloomed in 2001 in Processing.

            <h3>2.1.1 Muriel Cooper: from Visual Language Workshop to Information Landscapes</h3>
            In 1994, a few months before suddenly passing away, Muriel Cooper, graphic designer and researcher,
            presented,
            at TED5 Conference, her project <i>Information Landscapes</i>, the result of the Visual Language
            Workshop’s
            research
            of the prior decade. The Visual Language Workshop (VLW) was founded by Cooper in 1974.

          After having worked
          for
          over twenty years as a designer and art director at MIT Press, Cooper moved towards education and created
          a
          hybrid space, in which teaching and research intersected: the transdisciplinary approach inspired by the
          Bauhaus and the rigorous graphic investigations of the Swiss Style equally permeated her projects’
          development. With the assistance of her students, Cooper cross-referenced media, materials, and processes,
          echoing the explorations of European postmodernist graphic designers of the same period, such as Weingart
          or
          Gerstner. Operating within MIT, the cradle of computer science, gave Cooper the opportunity to rapidly
          access
          powerful computers. She embraced these as an additional experimentation tool: <i>Information Landscapes</i>
          represents one of the most remarkable results and a groundbreaking moment of her career.
          Adding graphic design preoccupations, such as legibility and typographic arrangement, to data selection
          and
          fruition—a field equally explored within MIT through the research project DataLand<span
            class="fnnum">[70]</span> —Cooper focused on the
          three-dimensionality and depth of the inherent architecture of the computer. She foresaw this space as a
          means
          to develop interfaces that embraced the simultaneity and superposition of information and expanded the
          potentiality of human perception.<span class="fnnum">[71]</span> Cooper’s purpose was to redefine graphic
          design,<span class="fnnum">[72]</span> integrating McLuhan’s
          theories of simultaneous relationships “where a visual space is an organized continuum of a uniform
          connected
          kind.”<span class="fnnum">[73]</span> With her investigation, Cooper showed alternatives to Adobe and
          Apple’s linearity and flatness: the
          black background opposed the white page simulated by the WYSIWYG interfaces (see fig. 1.7); Cooper’s
          zoom-in
          brought you “inside” the interface itself and not “closer” to the page’s surface (see fig. 1.5); the
          interaction with the information was flexible and multiplied the observer’s possible points of view,
          countering the constraint and rigidity of Apple’s desktop space.<span class="fnnum">[74]</span> This
          thesis
          postulates that this
          flexibility
          has opened interesting paths for design research based on “multiversality” as opposed to mainstream design
          research focusing on “universality.” This flexibility reflects the ideals of inclusion and openness which
          were
          developed throughout the Processing community years later, as this thesis exemplifies in later sections.
          Muriel Cooper’s work informed Processing and inspired its creators on several levels. Ben Fry’s work—as
          part
          of the contemporary Information Design and Data Visualization scene—reflected formally and conceptually
          Cooper’s effort of connecting to the inner architecture of the computer to translate data into compelling
          and
          relevant visuals, allowing access to complex information.
          Additionally, Cooper’s methodological approach, resonating with the Bauhaus’, has greatly influenced the
          pedagogical perspective that shaped Processing creation: “the idea of traditional foundational studies was
          really important to Processing. I thought it was another Bauhaus moment. I thought, in the same way that
          during the Bauhaus era we moved from arts-and-crafts production into industrialized production, it was
          time
          to
          move from industrial production into the computer software, information-based production.”<span
            class="fnnum">[75]</span>
          Another element completing the creation of the multifaceted Processing came from computational design.
          Cooper’s practice, impregnated by experimentation and trans-disciplinarity, opened the path for
          implementing
          computation as a means for visual expression.

          <h3>2.1.2 John Maeda: from Aesthetics + Computation Group to Design by Numbers</h3>
          The Aesthetics + Computation Group (ACG) was founded by John Maeda in 1996 to continue the work put in
          place
          by Muriel Cooper. Back to the United States following his graphic design studies in Japan, John Maeda
          wanted
          to further explore the intersection of art, design, and technology. The particularity of Maeda’s lab
          proposal
          was the use of programming as a creative tool to explore new forms in graphic design. At the time,
          programming
          was a territory almost exclusively related to computer science and mathematics. Despite the pioneer
          exploration initiated in the 1970s by a fringe of artists, the idea of programming as a visual tool had
          not
          yet been implemented in any research institution or program. Attracted by this unconventional approach,
          Reas
          and Fry decided to join the program and, working under the supervision of Maeda, they planted the

          seeds of
          Processing. “I don’t think Processing would exist without John Maeda. The story starts there. Ben and I
          both
          came to MIT to study with John specifically because he was bridging ideas of computer science and design
          together,” said Reas.<span class="fnnum">[76]</span>
          To teach programming to designers and visual artists with no coding skills, Maeda developed a simple,
          accessible, and easy-to-use digital tool, Design by Numbers (DBN), implementing elementary commands to
          create
          dynamic images in a black and white 100x100 pixel screen canvas.<span class="fnnum">[77]</span> Through
          its
          simplicity, DBN had already
          integrated the concept of accessibility that Processing would come to develop years later. The concise and
          friendly interface was equipped with few buttons, and the concept “code, push play, and see” foresaw how
          visual people could seize and appropriate programming, quickly visualize the result of their work, and
          avoid
          the tedious labor with text and math.
          Maeda pushed his undertaking even further: alongside his mission to educate designers to use code as a
          tool
          for visual expression, he unveiled the inner structure of software thus inviting the students to
          appropriate
          digital tools. “My intent is to help build a basic understanding of the process behind creating a computer
          program. […] You probably won’t be able to program the next competitor to Adobe’s last arsenal, but you
          will
          at least be able to appreciate the hidden alphanumeric chaos that underlies the digital design tools that
          many
          designers take for granted.”<span class="fnnum">[78]</span> His work, imbued with the preoccupation of
          countering Adobe’s “arsenal,” sought
          to equip new generations of designers with the necessary understanding of software development, so as to
          shape
          their critical eye regarding the digital tools that were colonizing the graphic design field.

          <h3>2.1.3 Casey Reas and Ben Fry: Processing</h3>
          While David Carson and Neville Brody were experimenting with Photoshop and Illustrator and exploring their
          creative potential, Casey Reas and Ben Fry were already questioning the methodological limitations
          inherent
          to
          these tools. Visual artists with different practices, both interested in challenging their work through
          the
          intersection of art and science, Reas and Fry were aware of the constraints of the ready-made digital
          tools
          that appeared and arose at the end of the twentieth century. According to Fry, “tools like Photoshop and
          Illustrator […] allow you to build things, but really they separate you from the medium in a way that’s
          not
          always helpful. More importantly, you’re restricted by what the companies building those tools are making
          available to you. That’s a significant problem in terms of your creative output being controlled by a
          company
          whose priorities might not be aligned with yours and your best, most interesting, and most challenging
          work.”<span class="fnnum">[79]</span>
          The creative process, framed by the functions that software companies made available to designers, was
          tied
          and submitted to tools’ limitations.
          Reas’s additional preoccupation was to change the way software was being integrated into art and design
          education: “I thought that the way schools were teaching students how to use Photoshop and Illustrator was
          entirely surface and didn’t even begin to explore the possibilities of new media. I wanted there to be a
          deeper understanding of the medium, rather than just using it as a tool.”<span class="fnnum">[80]</span>
          Finally, a third concern permeated Reas and Fry’s research: the question of accessibility. If the
          interface
          proposed by Adobe and Apple allowed the users to quickly grasp computer and software’s functions, their
          cost
          was prohibitive for most artists and designers. On the other hand, the code available as an open source
          resource, thus completely free, represented a complex tool to apprehend without a formal training in
          computer
          science and programming. As teaching assistants at ACG, Reas and Fry had the opportunity to run workshops
          introducing Design by Numbers to designers. That was a breakthrough moment for recognizing the importance
          of
          a
          user-friendly interface to communicate a coding tool: “Those workshops really opened my eyes. We could sit
          with a group of people who had never coded before—people who were designers—and within an hour, they were
          making stuff.”<span class="fnnum">[81]</span> This sentence echoes Susan Kare’s claim about the time
          needed
          to learn how to use a
          Macintosh.<span class="fnnum">[82]</span>
          Learning from that experience, Reas and Fry decided to bring DBN to another level and expand the potential
          of
          the tool: “Processing tried to take the minimal aspects of DBN but also

          <h2>2.2 Processing: Language, Environment, Community</h2>
          As a synthesis of Cooper’s design approach, Maeda’s use of computational design, and the open source
          sharing
          model, the first version of Processing, was released in 2001. Processing’s purpose was to create an
          intuitive
          system like Maeda’s Design by Numbers, but expandable as a toolkit: adding color, changing size of the
          canvas,
          but also evolving with additional libraries the tool allowed to envision more complex and ambitious
          creative
          outcomes. Moreover, the program was available online as a free software, easy to download and, once
          installed,
          it was functioning as a self-contained programming environment. Any user, even a beginner, did not need
          extra
          features (not even an internet connection) to start “sketching” with code.
          The idea of “sketching” is central to understand the project’s essence. Unlike traditional coding
          methodologies, Processing wanted to focus on process more than on outcome. The user could visualize their
          code-generated images almost instantaneously, instead of having to write a complete program before seeing
          the
          results; this meant giving room for unexpected results to emerge, and ultimately embracing mistakes and
          failure as an active part of the learning. These components made Processing the perfect pedagogical tool
          for
          foundational Art and Design studies and a powerful device for creative professionals.
          The interface of Processing 1.0 was similar to the one developed for DBN (and never fundamentally
          evolved);
          it
          was composed of two windows: one in which to write code and one, activated by the “play” button, in which
          to
          “run” (visualize) the sketch. References and examples were available on the Processing website, which was
          used
          as an open documentation platform to support users in navigating the environment. Finally, Processing,
          like
          the operating system Linux years earlier, took advantage of a community of developers, creatives, and
          aficionados to expand and grow.
          In 2018, with the publication of “A Modern Prometheus” Casey Reas and Ben Fry summarized almost two
          decades
          of
          Processing history and reframed it as having been built on three main interlaced components: language,
          environment, community.<span class="fnnum">[84]</span> In the following sections, we will unveil how these
          components embeds different and
          interwoven moral values, and propose a different way to apprehend the triad internet, computer, and
          software.

          <h3>2.2.1 Language: Code, Emergence and Multiverse</h3>
          <p class="quote">A lot of people would say that having to write the code to produce the page and images is
            actually a huge step
            backward from having a tool to do it. But one of the ways John [Maeda] put it that always struck me was
            this
            idea that you wouldn’t have a painter who doesn’t know how to mix paint themselves or work within their
            medium.<span class="fnnum">[85]</span>

          Code is a system of symbols and rules used to communicate instructions to a computer. It can be considered
          the
          raw material, the alphabet, of programming language. Software is a digital medium that, programmed with
          code
          in a specific language, allows—in the case of creative software—to express and visualize ideas. When we
          use
          ready-made software like Adobe’s, we use functionalities that have been chosen and compiled by Adobe’s
          software developers to allow users to execute specific tasks. For instance, using Photoshop, we can change
          the
          contrast of a picture by sliding a cursor or modifying a curve on a graph. This action is possible because
          someone who “speaks the code” (the software developer) has provided an interface that eases the
          communication
          between users and machines: we can give instructions to a computer without typing them in its inherent
          language.
          Designers have been living with the illusion (and students have been educated with the conviction) that
          ready-made software, because of its interface, was the quickest and easiest means to digitally draw and
          visualize ideas. Nevertheless, taking the example of motion graphics programs like Adobe After Effects,
          the
          interface is so

          complex that a deep understanding of the software becomes highly laborious and
          time-consuming.
          The interface does not automatically shorten the digital visual work’s creation learning curve. Moreover,
          the
          pre-chosen features may prevent discovering unexpected outcomes. Despite slick interfaces’ support,
          graphic
          design productions are, as a result, often standardized because of a superficial knowledge of the
          complexity
          of the programs and, consequently, of a limited use of the multiple features of ready-made software.
          Casey Reas, in his interview “How to Draw with Code,” related his method of laying out ideas and
          sketching:
          his process included pencil and paper, but also a text editor in which, instead of writing notes for
          essays,
          poetry, or fiction, he organized logic and procedures.<span class="fnnum">[86]</span> He wrote code to
          sketch; he sketched code. Within
          Reas’s research about “emergence,”<span class="fnnum">[87]</span> culminated in his <i>Process Series</i>, a
          few
          lines of code and simple rules
          sufficed to visualize unexpected and compelling results that evolved following different combinations and
          variables. The rigid frame of ready-made software would not allow the flexibility and malleability that
          programming provides and, furthermore, would prevent the discovery of serendipitous accidents.
          Comparing his software to a music score, Reas explained that every time the program ran, it was performed
          differently, and new elements emerged and unfolded. “I think this is a very exciting way to work with
          computers because, stereotypically, they are such calculating precise machines, but being able to allow
          unexpected things to happen.”<span class="fnnum">[88]</span> Embracing the infinite possibilities of each
          software’s performance echoes
          with
          Molnár’s expansion of the creative spectrum with the use of randomness.<span class="fnnum">[89]</span>
          Both
          processes, allowed by the
          flexibility of the code and the potential of algorithmic procedural design, incapsulating the acceptance
          of
          different, divergent, and eventually contradictory results. Accepting every instance as part of the whole
          makes their approach naturally inclined to include diversity.
          As Muriel Cooper already suggested with <i>Information Landscape</i>’s design, this trajectory opposes the
          “universal” design supported by contemporary mainstream design trends. Instead of creating rigid
          frameworks,
          containing a limited number of possibilities (and structurally excluding some), a flexible design,
          centered
          on
          the idea of “multiverse,” would create, this thesis postulates, spaces for inclusion, and would open the
          path
          for a new design paradigm.

          <h3>2.2.2 Environment: An Expanded Field</h3>
          <p class="quote">P5.js is a reinterpretation of Processing. It takes the initial goals of Processing and
            asks,
            “What does that
            mean for today?” […] Instead of trying to retrofit those ideas into a project, we wondered: Can we try
            to
            build values of diversity and inclusion into the code from the get-go? We were making decisions in every
            moment, asking who are we privileging here? Who are we excluding? Who are we including? How do we make
            our
            message more explicit?<span class="fnnum">[90]</span>
            <br>— Lauren McCarthy, “How Computer Code Became a Modern Design Medium”, 2018.
          </p>
          <br>

          In addition to the flexibility of the coding language, The Processing Development Environment (PDE)—the
          original software environment allowing beginners to start writing sketches—contributed to building a
          platform
          fostering values of inclusion. With the PDE, Processing’s creators aspired “to make the interface easy to
          use
          and the documentation clear and free of unnecessary technical jargon.”<span class="fnnum">[91]</span>
          Proposing code-based software with a
          clear and comprehensible interface was a novelty in the free software development culture. Free and open
          source software, rooted in the text-based Unix programming philosophy, had very poor User Interfaces (UI).
          Culturally, free software developers were programming for themselves and other “experts” of the community,
          who
          did not need efficient UIs to navigate the software.<span class="fnnum">[92]</span> The PDE was the first
          step to shift the paradigm of the
          free open source culture; it opened programming to communities, as the one of designers, that culturally
          did
          not “belong.”
          A huge step forward in shifting Processing toward a more inclusive environment was accomplished with
          Lauren
          McCarthy’s contribution: the JavaScript web library p5.js. Aware of the lack of diversity in programming
          communities, McCarthy joined Processing’s leading team in 2013 to expand the environment to become more
          inclusive. “One of the things we thought about really early on with p5 was

          the culture on GitHub, which is
          like the main place where the code base is developed. A lot of the conversations can be very aggressive,
          and
          you have to put yourself forward as an expert in order to be listened to. And we just really wanted to
          change
          that dynamic.”<span class="fnnum">[93]</span> With the p5.js JavaScript library, Processing was
          transferred
          from the local PDE to the web,
          opening access to programming to an expanded community of non-expert eager of learning creative coding.
          The potential of cyberspace envisioned by web activist Aaron Swartz a few years earlier, as a place for
          “rather than retreating into a ‘cathedral’ of elite programmers, […] making the creation, distribution,
          and
          freedom of information as easy and frictionless as possible”<span class="fnnum">[94]</span> was fully
          exploited by the Processing community
          with the release of the p5.js web editor, developed by Cassie Tarakajian in 2018. This move allowed to
          broaden
          Processing’s teaching and learning community, including high and middle school educational institutions
          that
          could now take advantage of the browser’s accessibility to introduce coding to younger students, without
          having to download and install software.

          <h3>2.2.3 Community: A Platform for Education</h3>
          Observing the evolution of the Processing environment from the local PDE to the more accessible browser,
          education has been proven central for the Processing platform. This pedagogical interest shaped the
          community
          that grew around the project, defining a dynamic that distanced itself from the general open source
          methodology based on the collaboration for interest. Open source software development has, classically, a
          communal aim of creating, through a collective mind, a more efficient piece of software. In the case of
          Processing, the community comes together in its joint mission of providing tools and platforms for sharing
          knowledge.
          Processing community’s expansion leaned on the generous and relentless work of individuals, who
          contributed
          to
          the growth of the project, always in the spirit of sharing learning opportunities:
          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">The longest-running and most prominent effort is Sinan Ascioglu’s OpenProcessing, which
            recently launched a
            new interface that is compatible with p5.js sketches. Earlier initiatives include the Free Art Bureau’s
            Processing Cities initiatives to start user groups in cities around the world, Tom Carden and Karsten
            Schmidt’s Processing Hacks wiki, and Tom Carden’s blog aggregator. Early social media sites created
            community
            and energy around Processing through tags used within sites like Del.ici.ous and Flickr. OpenProcessing
            is
            going strong, but these other initiatives have changed as the web and the community has shifted.<span
              class="fnnum">[95]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          Looking back at the project’s origins, the most influential figure who contributed to the expansion of
          Processing was—and still is—Dan Shiffman. Adjunct professor at ITP—a two-year Master’s program at Tisch
          School
          of the Arts, New York University—Shiffman joined the project right after his graduation at ITP in 2003.
          Processing was, at the time, a new tool for introducing programming to artists and designers. Within his
          research of unorthodox ways to teach programming and to unfold the potential of coding, Shiffman embraced
          Processing as an opportunity to develop new curricula at ITP. Wanting to experiment with reversed pedagogy
          (lectures at home; exercises in class) and foreseeing the potential of the web as an accessible platform
          for
          sharing pedagogical content, he started recording his lectures and sharing them with his student on
          Vimeo.<span class="fnnum">[96]</span>
          These videos were not intended to become pedagogical material for a more extensive community, nor were
          they
          introductory tutorials to Processing; yet, they were accessible to anyone who wanted to discover the
          potential
          of the new coding language. The interest around Shiffman’s videos grew exponentially, revealing the
          promise
          of
          the web as a pedagogical platform and the potential of Processing as a pedagogical tool. Dan Shiffman
          became
          the most prominent ambassador of Processing, bringing together a community of people eager to learn and
          share
          the new tool.
          Born as an experiment, Shiffman’s videos created the building blocks for future development on the web.
          Hello
          Processing, a one-hour coding tutorial, was the precursor of Cassie Tarakajian’ web editor, featuring, for
          first time, a window for coding embedded in the browser. The YouTube channel The Coding Train was the most
          influential project that followed.

          With more than a million followers, The Coding Train is still the primary
          reference for learning creative coding, from the basics to more advanced features.
          The pedagogical implication of this phenomenon is, of course, non-negligible. Furthermore, The Coding
          Train
          contributed tremendously to building the Processing community. Without a doubt, part of the YouTube
          channel’s
          success is Dan Shiffman’s personality—an undeniably critical aspect in the construction of any community.
          The
          concept of accessibility, central to Processing development, brings with it the meaning of closeness to
          others. “Most essentially, Processing is about people. It’s about individuals and collective learning and
          exploration; it’s about sharing ideas and giving what you can.”<span class="fnnum">[97]</span>

          <h2>2.3 Conclusion: From Platform to System of Values</h2>
          Considering the dramatic development of technology over the last twenty years, questioning the relevance
          of
          Processing as a digital tool in the contemporary software realm seems legitimate. By observing its
          trajectory
          and the steps undertaken by its creators, ambassadors, and community, it’s clear that Processing has
          evolved
          far beyond being a platform, to become a carrier of values.
          Initiated embedding visions of interdisciplinarity, collaboration and radical exploration in the field of
          the
          arts, Processing pursued its path regularly reassessing its core values. The flexibility of the coding
          language, the use of internet as an open and accessible sharing platform, and the focus on inclusive
          education, continue to contribute to shifting the meaning of “free open source” beyond software
          programming
          culture. Processing was able to bring together communities of non-coders, and in doing so, it opened
          programming to anyone interested in exploring alternative ways to approach design. Processing gave the
          opportunity to marginalized and unrepresented communities to exist outside the standardized and expensive
          design realm offered by mainstream tech infrastructures, continually embodying their spirit of openness
          and
          inclusion.
          In 2011, the creation of the Processing Foundation formalized the missions of its community, centered
          around
          values of diversity and inclusion: “The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the
          communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because
          of
          their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability.<span class="fnnum">[98]</span>

          </div>

          <div class="twoCol">
            In 2017, Casey Reas reassessed the core values of Processing, synthesized in the triad
            “access-community-free.”<span class="fnnum">[99]</span> These principles have spread in the graphic design
            field, creating new territories
            in
            which design development focuses on inclusive and democratic methodologies.
            In the previous chapter, the three components, “language-environment-community,” provided a prism of
            analysis
            to explain the complexity of Processing as a platform. In this chapter, we exemplify the design shift,
            proposing a prism of observation based on Processing’s triad of values.
            Since the middle of the 2000s, graphic designers have questioned their position within the production
            chain
            and redefined their practice accordingly. Three patterns emerged, stressing Processing’s core values each
            in
            a
            different way. First, the rise of hybrid practices, which merged analog and digital tools, showed how the
            free
            open source sharing model and DIY methodologies had empowered accessibility and democratized design
            conception
            and production. Moreover, the influence of generative design and creative coding revealed a new path
            towards
            a
            design focusing on the “multiple,” as opposed to the “universal,” that opened conversations with diverse
            communities. Finally, the reappropriation of the publishing realm, leaning on free open source software
            and
            the web, subverted the graphic and editorial design’s chain of production, and provided new perspectives
            in
            these fields. These three axes are emblematic of the designers’ new stance in providing methodologies
            which
            now foster accessibility and inclusion, going against the standardization of design imposed by tech
            monopolies.

            <br><br>
            <h2>3.1 Access: Hybrid Practices</h2>
            Inspired by the free open source and Do It Yourself (DIY) cultures, contemporary graphic designers and
            graphic
            design studios have embraced, over the last two decades, unorthodox project methodologies and, through the
            self-production of devices, have developed hybrid practices that mix analog, digital, and computational
            tools.
            After decades of staring at screens and claiming the death of paper and printing, the rise of these
            unconventional practices revealed how new technologies can improve graphic design esthetics and generate
            new
            opportunities for revamping traditional, and sometimes obsolete, printing methods. DIY, open source, and
            hacker cultures are actively providing valid methodologies to achieve this improvement. Today, we witness
            the
            conception of community and spaces built around objects of creation such as a RISO duplicator or a
            letterpress, set aside laser cutters, plotters, and 3d printers. “Hacking,” intended in its more
            contemporary
            meaning of “ingenious combination, or invention,”<span class="fnnum">[100]</span> is crucial and provides
            relevant experimentations
            intersecting new technologies with traditional techniques. This unorthodox attitude embraces the lesson
            taught
            by Processing and restores the role of computers as tools serving the design practice, instead of
            controlling
            the practice itself. As a result, compelling combinations of realms, previously considered in opposition,
            are
            blooming, and altering the graphic design esthetics.

            <h3>3.1.1 Digital Fabrication and Traditional Printing Techniques</h3>
            By investigating the crossing of analog and digital processes, two patterns emerged as the most relevant
            in
            contemporary design practice, both aiming to emancipate designers from the esthetics’ normalization and
            commodification.
            The community grown around Processing and creative coding pursued its mission of developing digital
            easy-to-use tools and providing alternative software and platforms for the visual arts. Their work is
            often
            focused on building interactive devices and installations, frequently found on the frontier between art
            and
            design. The connection between creative coding

          and printing has been translated into the development of
          libraries that help transfer generated drawings on paper using mainly RISO duplicators, drawing machines
          such
          as pen-plotters, and eventually obsolete machines which have been hacked to add materiality to
          code-generated
          patterns. The results of these explorations, albeit sometimes facing issues of resolution and scale, have
          led
          to some fascinating processes. Louis Eveillard’s experimentations with his hacked embroider machine
          Tricodeur
          (a project developed in collaboration with 2roq and Sew&Laine in Bordeaux) and Licia He’s generated
          pen-plotted paintings both prove that young generations of artists and designers are susceptible to these
          opportunities and are, without inhibitions, dismantling the traditional separation between the space of
          screens and the one of studios.
          If emerging models connected to the realm of creative coding are growing within a territory where art and
          design intersect, digital fabrication has played a critical role in developing the professional graphic
          design
          practice, relying on DIY methodologies for the auto-production of tools from a professional production
          standpoint.
          Digital fabrication processes—intended as laser cutting and 3d printing techniques—have successfully
          contributed to giving new perspectives to traditional printing methods, and particularly to the letterpress.
          Since the middle of the 2010s, printers and designers have explored new production territories to expand
          their
          typefaces collections for letterpress printing. In 2016, the Berlin-based experimental letterpress workshop
          a98p had “tried it all: plexi, maple, pear, resin, magnesium, polymer, formica. CNC milling, 3D-printing,
          pantograph cutting, etched metal, vacuum-forming.”<span class="fnnum">[101]</span> Between 2014 and 2017,
          the London-based letterpress
          printer
          and design studio New North Press developed compelling experimentations, such as the 3d printed typeface
          A23D
          or the laser cut hexagonal woodblocks system AHP Six, both projects aimed at capitalizing on new
          technologies
          to empower professional productions in traditional printing.<span class="fnnum">[102]</span>
          Over the last few years, the development of affordable and valid desktop laser cutters and 3d printers has
          pushed the boundaries of graphic experimentation even further, allowing a disinhibited typographical
          approach,
          defying classical typesetting canons. The work of printers and designers like the British Thomas Mayo or the
          American Ryan Molloy are examples of how digital fabrication, particularly that of laser cutting, has been
          organically implemented in graphic design practice as an active part of the design process.
          Digital fabrication could legitimately be considered one of the main advancements of letterpress since the
          adoption of photopolymer plates in the 1980s; these have contributed to expanding the community of designers
          around letterpress, providing a renewal of tradition and the development of a new craft in opposition to
          over-digitalized contemporary design productions.

          <h3>3.1.2 The Open Source Sharing Model and the New Craft</h3>
          Within the context of this new craft, some cases have proven how the open source model of free exchange and
          collaboration is relevant to other fields such as traditional printing. In 2018, Martin Schneider and
          Dominik
          Schmitz published the plans of The Open Press Project, a “tiny 3D-printed etching press that will let you
          use
          these techniques outdoors, in your living room or small studio.”<span class="fnnum">[103]</span> The two
          designers from Cologne, Germany,
          aware of the challenge of accessing an etching press, “wanted to give more people the option to use them for
          their art in places where printmaking was not possible before.”<span class="fnnum">[104]</span> The project
          received extraordinary support,
          and a community proliferated around it, proving the relevance of enabling easy access to printing tools.
          New sharing opportunities brought by the internet offered a new dimension to the democratization of design
          foresaw by Enzo Mari in <i>Autoprogettazione?</i> Mari’s reappropriation of the objects and its conception
          and
          design, and the demystification of the industrial production<span class="fnnum">[105]</span> are both
          empowered by the cyberspace and
          “electronic neighborhoods.”<span class="fnnum">[106]</span>
          Looking from this perspective, the model of free exchange of knowledge for printing opportunities bloomed
          during the global health crisis in 2020. During the COVID19 pandemic, the portable letterpress Provisional
          Press proved the relevance of implementing DIY methodologies to create affordable tools to

          teaching. Considering student’s financial and space restrictions, Steve Garst along with his wife Liz Garst,
          and in collaboration with Scott Moore of Moore Wood Type, designed a kit that could “be built by someone
          with
          little woodshop skills but access to a laser cutter.”<span class="fnnum">[107]</span> This press offered “an
          inexpensive alternative that
          [could] act as a transitional press to enable students to make prints when they may not have access to a
          large
          steel press.”<span class="fnnum">[108]</span> All plans and instructions are available online and, faithful
          to the open source free-exchange
          spirit, “free for anyone to use and modify as they experiment with building their own press.”<span
            class="fnnum">[109]</span>
          These ideas resonate with the “modular, expandable, and customizable kit”<span class="fnnum">[110]</span>
          proposed by Casey Reas and Ben Fry
          with Processing and have been transferred from digital to analog, from screen to print. The concept of
          accessibility is, thus, crucial: the auto-productive and auto-didactic approach inspired by the free open
          source sharing model fosters accessibility not only in the conception and production of design, but also for
          educational purposes, inside and outside of institutions.

          <h2>3.2 Community: Generative Identities</h2>
          Since the beginning of the 2000s, we have noticed a shift in corporate identity design towards visual
          identities called “flexible,”<span class="fnnum">[111]</span> in which the classical pyramidal structure of
          companies’ language—from logo to
          applications—has been replaced by a multiplicity of signs communicating different facets of the brand. In
          post-WWII era, industrial production shifted from the manufacture of war supplies to commercial goods, and
          the
          importance of “branding” the companies to make them recognizable and sellable became central.<span
            class="fnnum">[112]</span> Designers such
          as Massimo Vignelli and Paul Rand appropriated and applied, in the United States of the 1960s-1970s, the
          “design of systems,”— developed by figures of the Swiss Style such as Josef Müller-Brockmann—to shape
          commercial communication. The “Logo” (with a capital L) became the focus of corporate identity design with
          the
          mission of encapsulating the brand’s values as being timeless and universal.<span class="fnnum">[113]</span>
          The classical corporate
          identity
          manual designed to set companies’ visual language, was built on one sign, spreading from top to bottom in a
          pyramid of applications. The logo at the top had to be respected as a dogma.
          At the beginning of the 2000s, the relationship with costumers radically changed due to the establishment of
          new channels of commercial communication, those mainly provided by the internet. Companies faced a newly
          fragmented market, in which larger communities—made up of different ages, origins, and statuses—had access
          to
          products and brands. The pyramidal communication with the “Logo” positioned at the top became obsolete and
          its
          values of timelessness and universality were questioned. Flexible identities established a system of
          communication based on variations and iterations of signs, bringing the brands’ visual language towards a
          horizontal, transversal and network-based system. The identity of the brand became a choral idiom,
          addressing
          a message of openness and flexible complexity to a broader and more diverse audience.

          <h3>3.2.1 From Flexible to Generative Identities</h3>
          In this context, generative design—visual creations generated with code—has conveyed interesting
          methodologies
          to create iterations of signs addressing larger communities and emphasizing the concept of “multiversal
          design.” Generative identities have been proven particularly relevant for cultural institutions, museums,
          and
          cities as a means to transmit sets of values and to open conversations with diverse communities, sometimes
          allowing for active participation in defining the entity’s visual language.
          The first emblematic example of generative design used to conceive flexible visual communication is the
          identity for Casa da Musica, a music hall in Porto, Portugal. Designed in 2007 by the New-Yorker graphic
          design studio Sagmeister & Walsh, the identity pioneered the idea of using creative coding to expand the
          design system, and this at a time when creative coding was gaining a reputation as a tool for mainly
          artistic
          expression. The identity

          systems’ inspiration came from Rem Khoolaas’s presentation of the building to the
          city of Porto, in which he defined the architecture as a “conglomeration of many layers of meanings.” <span
            class="fnnum">[114]</span>The
          building naturally became the logo’s shape, representing this conglomeration. The logo design is based on
          different views of the building—north, south, east, west, top, and bottom— and its color palette varies,
          generated by a piece of software, the Logo Generator, created for the client. Scanning the image
          representing
          the current event or concert, the software can identify and apply to the logo a color palette in harmony
          with
          the image, and consistent with the event’s communication. Potentially, the instances of the logo are
          infinite,
          corresponding to each event and speaking to any public Casa da Musica would like to reach.
          Sagmeister & Walsh intended, with this work, to create an appealing and dynamic visual language which
          distanced communication from a “overrated sameness”<span class="fnnum">[115]</span> and not specific to the
          idea of opening conversations
          and
          embracing communities. Nevertheless, their project unveiled new applications for creative coding within the
          graphic design practice, in foreseeing opportunities for inclusive “multiversal” design.
          Several notable projects following Casa da Musica, took advantage of these new opportunities. Studio Neue
          designed in 2010 the communication and visual identity for the peninsula of Nordkin, striving to increase
          the

          studio was able to unite the
          different municipalities, overriding conflicts of interests, and proposed a logo generated by the changes of
          wind and temperature. These communal natural elements served to connect the peninsula’s different
          identities.<span class="fnnum">[117]</span>
          That same year, for the celebration of its twenty-fifth anniversary, MIT entrusted the Berliner design
          studio
          TheGreeEyl and E Ron Kang, founder of Math Practice, with the redesign of its Media Lab’s visual identity.
          The
          identity wanted to manifest MIT’s spirit of transparency, mutual inspiration, and collaboration.<span

          <h3>3.2.2 Generative Design and Participatory Practices</h3>
          If previous cases were able to introduce creative coding as a tool for a more flexible communication, the
          most
          striking example, thus far, of generative identity used for participatory design is the Bologna City
          Branding.
          In response to the open call for the redesign of the Italian city’s communication, Michele Pastore and
          Matteo
          Bartoli proposed a graphic system that embraced Bologna’s plurality, aimed at illustrating the different
          realities of its inhabitants and tourists alike. To translate the richness and complexity of the city, the
          designers conceived an alphabet of geometrical elements, using the architectural archetypes of the city
          itself.
          The key element of the city’s identity is the online logo generator “ebologna.it,” which allows the citizens
          to participate in the creation of a visual language: “Through the online logo generator, anyone can become
          actor of the process of creation, adding a personal ‘fragment’ to the global identity of the city. The
          communication of Bologna is thus propelled in a new and unexplored dimension. This isn’t just a flexible
          identity system, it is—maybe for the first time—participatory.”<span class="fnnum">[120]</span> According to
          2019 data, 36,276 generated
          logos
          were shared online, 137 different logos were adopted by the municipality, and 183 generated logos were used
          by
          private companies on the territory.<span class="fnnum">[121]</span>
          The idea of designing for the “multiverse” regains all its meaning: the community is involved in the process
          of communicating their city; citizens feel part of a whole, in respect of their identity and their voice;
          and
          the municipality opens dialogue and participation. Design thus becomes a tool fostering diversity and
          inclusion.

          <h2>3.3 Free: Independent Publishing</h2>
          Additional proposals for redefining the graphic designers’ position came from the independent publishing
          realm. Since the beginning of the 2000s, graphic designers, particularly in Europe, have questioned the
          editorial design practice and reappropriated printed objects as territories for research and
          experimentation.

          This approach is comparable to the artists’ emancipation, which occurred between the 1960s and the 1970s
          through the “democratic multiple”<span class="fnnum">[122]</span> and made possible by newly accessibley and
          less expensive printing
          techniques. The printed object’s democratization experienced a rebirth in the contemporary graphic design
          scene, thanks to the advent of the internet. Graphic designers, mastering the editorial production’s chain
          from conception to production, began colonizing the publishing realm and adopted e-commerce to be set free
          from the economic and logistic burden of distribution. Furthermore, they embraced the web as an experimental
          publishing framework, including the use of cyberspace and free software as production tools, thus shaping
          unconventional visual expression.

          <h3>3.3.1 The Contemporary “Democratic Multiple”</h3>
          Relying on DIY methodologies for production and distribution, marginal micro-publishing realities have
          emerged
          over the last fifteen years, giving a new impetus to the independent publishing market and revamping the
          book
          as a democratic object of communication.
          The Swiss publishing project Rollo Press, founded at the end of 2007 by the graphic designer Urs Lehni,
          happened “accidentally” after Lehni decided to purchase a second-hand RISO duplicator on eBay.<span
            class="fnnum">[123]</span> Since then,
          Rollo Press has served as a publishing house and printing platform for contemporary artists. Embracing the
          rough esthetic of the Risograph technique and, leaning on the graphic design skills of its founder, the
          micro-publishing house has already distributed more than sixty titles. Rollo Press is one of many cases
          showing how graphic designers have extended their role, from conception to production. Using their practice
          to
          support and distribute contemporary artists’ work, they have undertaken the roles of editor and publisher in
          addition to that of designer. This approach shifted the “democratic multiple” from a means of
          self-expression
          to a tool for collaboration and curatorship.
          In some cases, independent editorial entities—once just experiments—have now established themselves as
          realities and have grown to become references in the field of publishing “by graphic designers, for graphic
          designers.” The publishing houses B42 in France and Unit Edition in the UK are striking examples of this
          dynamic. Both were founded by accomplished graphic design studios—respectively by DeValence in 2008 and by
          Spin Studio alongside Adrian Shaughnessy in 2009—and have developed extended catalogs of books exploring
          different facets of the graphic design practice. Although B42 focuses on critical texts, and Unit Edition on
          graphic design productions, there are common threads to their practices, particularly in term of their
          efforts
          to present “subjects that are either neglected or ignored by mainstream publishers.”<span
            class="fnnum">[124]</span> They also both
          capitalized on online distribution to create a sustainable business model. Their endeavors have contributed
          to
          the democratization of the graphic design culture, without compromising on the quality of their
          publications.

          <h3>3.3.2 Independent Tools for Independent Publishing</h3>
          A more radical approach towards an uncompromised practice came at the beginning of the 2000s from entities
          committed to the Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).
          Founded in Brussels in 2006, Open Source Publishing (OSP) is one of the first graphic design collectives
          that
          committed to exclusively using FLOSS as a tool for a work’s production, and free open license for
          publication.
          Convinced of the limitation of dominant software’s interfaces (such as Adobe) often restricting the user to
          standardized design gestures, they questioned the influence of digital tools on their practice and looked
          for
          alternative graphic design studios’ models.<span class="fnnum">[125]</span> Inspired by open source software
          development, they also
          conceived
          alternative tools for graphic design to facilitate collaboration. In 2014, they initiated the free software
          Visual Culture that allows keeping track, visualizing, and sharing the visual history of in-progress files
          without losing the current version of the work. Inspired by the Git branching model used in open source
          software development they expanded its collaborative methodology to visual practices as graphic design.

          Visual
          Culture became thus an invitation for collaborations between professionals. Questioning the economic
          dependence on mainstream software, Open Source Publishing challenges graphic designers and educational
          institutions to act and dismantle this paradigm.<span class="fnnum">[126]</span>
          Responding to OSP’s invitation, Raphaël Bastide and Sarah Garcin started in 2017 PrePostPrint, a platform
          gathering experimental editorial projects conceived using FLOSS. Focusing on publishing, the French
          designers’
          ambition is to promote graphic design explorations based on unorthodox design methodologies relying on
          non-traditional and affordable tools of production.<span class="fnnum">[127]</span> Using the web as an
          alternative platform for creating
          layouts using HTML and CSS coding languages, they propose a production chain that allows the designer’s
          complete autonomy from traditional software. Their practice embraced the spirit of sharing knowledge through
          organizing workshops in schools, giving lectures, and gathering information about people, projects, and
          studios working with similar preoccupations.<span class="fnnum">[128]</span>
          Open Source Publishing and PrePostPrint are compelling examples of radical propositions to stand up against
          the tech giants’ monopolies and regain autonomy and freedom in the graphic design practice. Furthermore,
          this
          radicality has undeniably generated an array of original visual propositions, marking a break from
          conventional and standardized results obtained with mainstream digital tools. Nevertheless, regaining
          autonomy
          using the free software seems still complicated to implement on a regular basis in a graphic design
          practice,
          which often remains chained to a market ruled by standardized tools. Furthermore, the functionalities of
          unorthodox software such as Visual Culture or the possibility of web-to-print practices are still a mystery
          for the average designer, who is more at ease faced with Adobe interfaces than before two lines of code. Can
          this radical approach be implemented in everyday design practice? Open Source Publishing proposes the
          following:
          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">How could we dismantle the dominant logic [of closed software] if we do not react? In the
            closed environment
            in which the students are trained for their own alienation, schools have an essential role to play to
            change
            the world promised by the software industry. We dream of schools dedicating their budgets to free software
            creation, instructors’ training, and studio materials; schools that would build and redistribute free
            software, using it—why not?—as a means of communication. How many failures do we need to open our eyes,
            finally?<span class="fnnum">[129]</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>3.4 Conclusion: Towards a Practice Renewal</h2>
          Now that graphic design is tightly interwoven with tech giants’ infrastructures, designers struggle to
          identify alternative processes and tools to regain independence in their practice. In response to mainstream
          tools and standardized visual patterns imposed by the market’s rules, some designers have embraced the
          values
          promoted by Processing and found alternative processes to differentiate their work from normalized dynamics
          and shift their practice towards a more inclusive and responsible design.
          Nevertheless, each proposition has been shown to partially tackle the multi-faceted design dilemma: the
          practice is so entangled with tools and culture provided by the tech monopolies that a radical approach to
          extract the designers from this reality does not seem to solve the tension between original visual research
          and commercial production. To explore new trajectories for a practice renewal, graphic designers can, thus,
          take advantage of a multiplicity of tools and a combination of approaches belonging to different and
          sometimes
          divergent realms in the effort of apprehending the paradox of the design practice and compromising with it.
          Furthermore, as Processing has shown with its trajectory, and Open Source Publishing reiterated in their
          interview with Strabic, pedagogy is key for dismantling the dominant dynamic of the monopolies. Educational
          institutions have an essential role in identifying new methodologies for sharing knowledge and showing
          alternative frameworks of production.

          <div class="twoCol">
            Drastically reformed by the mainstream digital tools that arose at the end of the twentieth century, the
            graphic design practice is experiencing a critical methodological crisis. The armada of ready-made tools
            provided by companies shaped within the Silicon Valley paradox<span class="fnnum">[130]</span> has ruled
            the
            graphic design field, trapping
            graphic designers in an inextricable dilemma. The intuitive interfaces, software, and design components
            provided by Apple, Adobe, and Google allowed “bringing computers to the people,”<span
              class="fnnum">[131]</span> yet were responsible for
            commodifying the design tools and culture. Graphic designers are now tugged between the necessity of being
            part of a market and exiting the standardized visual pattern induced by the tech monopolies.
            Easy access to computers and software weakened the creative process, shifting the profession towards a
            technical skills compilation, emptied of critical skills. Furthermore, in the effort of conquering a
            broader
            market, the “access” provided by tech infrastructures focused on giving the visual keys to communicate and
            interact with the computer, forgetting “affordability” as its critical connotation. Mainstream digital
            tools
            are expensive and hardly affordable by independent designers, consolidating graphic design as a practice
            for
            privileged communities.

            In this context, two forces have counter powered this trend: radical design research and the free open
            source
            culture. Observing MIT’s trajectory of the end of the twentieth century, we have identified the roots of
            these
            two counterpowers in its research laboratories. The hackers’ culture—that have informed the open source
            sharing methods—and Muriel Cooper and John Maeda’s radical approach have fused into Casey Reas and Ben
            Fry’s
            project Processing. A pivotal event for the design field, Processing immensely contributed to
            reappropriating
            the graphic design practice as a critical process and redefining the graphic designers’ position, shifting
            the
            practice towards a design of diversity and inclusion. Processing has shown how, changing the paradigm of
            production and distribution, designers can integrate a prism of observation based on “multiversality”
            instead
            of “universality.” Furthermore, “accessibility” retrieves its economic, social, and political connotation,
            and
            the free and open access to digital tools and the free framework for sharing and learning become
            fundamental.
            By giving access to design tools to unprivileged communities, Processing fosters democratization of design
            instead of its pauperization.

            Some designers have invested in Processing as a tool and a system of values, reassessing their gaze on
            design
            production and integrating the social and political dimension as central. New methodologies, including the
            hybridization of production tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory generative design, and the use
            of
            cyberspace as a free framework, were invested as valid alternatives in their practice renewal.
            However, these approaches are still exceptions. In contemporary society, being a designer remains a
            privilege,
            and designing is still inherently perceived as an act of exclusion. When we design, we work to solve
            specific
            problems, focusing on specific audiences, responding to specific briefs of specific clients. So, how can
            designers work actively to define a more responsible and inclusive practice?
            Throughout this thesis, we have opposed start-up and free open source cultures, identifying polarities
            that
            arose from this dichotomy: close versus open; universal versus multiversal; centralized versus
            decentralized.
            How should the designers position themselves tugged between these opposite forces? This thesis proposes to
            refuse any alliance to a radical stance. The designer can create flexible responses to design questions by
            shifting the cursors between opposite dualities and regularly inspecting their work and position. The
            designer’s practice can be enriched by different combinations of values, becoming modulable, dynamic, and
            adjusted for each project.
            Who are we designing for? Who are we forgetting? Who are we excluding intentionally or unintentionally?

          we force the cursor towards one specific direction? These are some of the questions that may help
          designers navigate their practice. This proposition is not exhaustive, and the list of polarities can be
          extended and completed.
          Moreover, to enhance this proposition, it is paramount to focus on the intersection of “accessibility” and
          “inclusion.” As shown throughout this thesis, “accessibility” can be legitimately used to describe Apple and
          Adobe interfaces (user friendly, but not affordable), as well as a source code (free of use, but not easily
          understandable for non-coders). These two objects are both accessible but, considering the economic
          connotation of the term, represent different levels of inclusion. The crossing between the term
          “accessibility” and “inclusion” unfolds a semiotic territory that designers can explore to better visualize
          their project’s stance.
          To integrate in their practice a more responsible posture, designers are invited to get inspired by the
          Processing community that has been able, throughout the years, to regularly reassess their focus and shift
          from a position of radical research to open and flexible inclusivity. Designers must grow in the same
          direction. A paradox is embedded in designers’ professional practice, and this dilemma cannot and does not
          have to be solved. Yet, it should be apprehended. As a privileged community, designers have the
          responsibility
          of developing and breeding awareness and critical thinking for a more inclusive design.
          Moreover, Art and Design educational institutions are also responsible for integrating this prism in their
          teaching to equip students—professionals-to-be—with the critical eye necessary to confront the contemporary
          design dilemma. Some independent pedagogical projects have successfully created diverse and inclusive spaces
          for critical thinking and responsible creation. The Processing Foundation has developed an educational
          section
          gathering pedagogical material free to use: “Rather than endorse a specific curriculum, we’ve engaged with a
          variety of educators from our community, ranging from K12 teachers, to folks who lead workshops at
          hackerspaces, to university professors in interdisciplinary departments. We’ve asked them to share their
          teaching materials here, which anyone can use.”<span class="fnnum">[132]</span>
          Institutions cannot ignore the major shift that occurred in the design practice and, following the example
          of
          Processing, must learn from the free open source culture communities and integrate methodologies based on
          openness, decentralization, and horizontal collaboration.
